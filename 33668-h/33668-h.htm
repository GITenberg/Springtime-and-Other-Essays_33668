<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Why, then comes in the sweet o&rsquo; the
year.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&mdash;<i>Autolycus&rsquo;
Song</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Governesses used to tell us that the seasons of the year each
consist of three months, and of these March, April, and May make
the springtime.&nbsp; I should like to break the symmetry, and
give February to spring, which would then include February,
March, April, and May.&nbsp; It has been said that winter is but
autumn &ldquo;shyly shaking hands with spring.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
will, accordingly, make winter a short link of two
months&mdash;an autumnal and a vernal hand&mdash;December and
January.&nbsp; It is a little sad for autumn to have to make room
for chill November alongside of the happier months of September
and October.&nbsp; But autumn is a season of decadence and cannot
justly complain.</p>
<p>The autumnal flowers, which may be allowed to figure as a
prelude to spring, are few in number.&nbsp; My favourite is
lady&rsquo;s tresses (<i>Spiranthes</i>), so called from the
spiral twist in its inflorescence, which suggests braided
hair.&nbsp; <i>Gentiana amarella</i> I should like to include,
but its flowering-time is from 12th August to 8th September, and
summer has the <!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>stronger claim on it.&nbsp; Other
autumnal flowers are laurustinus and ivy.&nbsp; If we go by the
mean date nothing flowers in October or November, and in December
only the Christmas rose (<i>Helleborus niger</i>) is recorded by
Blomefield.</p>
<p>But the autumn months have a glory of their own which may vie
with the brightest hues of flowers.&nbsp; This great and
beautiful panorama begins with the yellowing of the lime-leaves,
which may occur as early as 17th August, but on the average is
seen on 14th September.&nbsp; It is followed towards the end of
September by a brown tint, showing itself in the leaves of the
horse-chestnut.&nbsp; It is appropriate that these two species,
which are not indigenous, <a name="citation2"></a><a
href="#footnote2" class="citation">[2]</a> should be the first to
fade into glory.&nbsp; But I must not insist on the point, for we
see wych-elm leaves fall 24th September, while the date for the
common elm is 28th October; and the elm is a foreigner compared
to the wych-elm, and retains a mark of its alien origin in not
setting seeds.</p>
<p>The syringa (<i>Philadelphus</i>) is another foreigner, which
early shows autumnal tints&mdash;yellowing on 27th
September.&nbsp; Then follow some native trees: the beech and
birch both turning yellow on 1st October, and being followed by
the maple on 7th October.&nbsp; I like the motherliness of the
half-grown beech, who refuses to drop her dead leaves in autumn,
hoping (as I imagine) that they will shelter her tender leaves in
the chilly springtime.&nbsp; The older beeches give up this
anxious care, and <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>doubtless laugh among themselves over
the fussiness of young mothers.&nbsp; They forget, no doubt, that
in the scrub at the feet of their own boles the habit
persists.</p>
<p>With regard to the fall of leaves, the sycamore begins to lose
them 2nd October; birch and cherry, 8th October; maple and
walnut, 12th October; aspen, 13th October; beech and elder, 13th
October; ash, 14th October; Lombardy poplar and Virginian
creeper, 18th October; honeysuckle, 22nd October; hazel, 26th
October; elm, 28th October; whitethorn, 30th October; plane, 3rd
November.&nbsp; Judging by a single observation of Blomefield,
the larch is the last performer in the drama of autumn.&nbsp; It
turns yellow on 8th November, and its leaves fall 15th
November.</p>
<p>Blomefield <a name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a> records that on 29th November the trees
are &ldquo;everywhere stript of leaves,&rdquo; so that some sort
of colour-drama has been in progress from the middle of September
to the end of November.&nbsp; It may be objected that what has
been said of autumn is but a catalogue of names and dates.&nbsp;
And this is true enough; but when we realise the glory of
autumnal decadence, it seems (however baldly recounted) to be a
fitting prelude to the great outbreak of new life&mdash;green
leaves and bright flowers that spring gives us.</p>
<p>In Blomefield&rsquo;s &ldquo;Calendar&rdquo; the difference
between December and January is exaggerated.&nbsp; For, as it
stands, it suggests that plants know that a new year has begun,
and all burst into flower <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>on 1st January.&nbsp; But that careful
naturalist points out <a name="citation4a"></a><a
href="#footnote4a" class="citation">[4a]</a> &ldquo;all those
phenomena which are referred to 1st January, as the earliest
date, may be considered as occasionally showing themselves in
December of the previous year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plants that bloom in winter, <i>i.e.</i> December and
January, are few enough.&nbsp; The Christmas rose gives us its
white or pink flowers in December, and the primrose may flower in
the first days of January&mdash;indeed, I seem to remember it in
Kent before Christmas, but I will not answer for it.&nbsp;
According to Blomefield, the honour of being the first plant to
awake must be given to the honeysuckle (<i>Lonicera
caprifolium</i>), which unfolds its leaves between 1st January
and 22nd February, <i>i.e.</i> on 21st January on the
average.&nbsp; This bold behaviour is all the more to its credit
since it is said by Hooker <a name="citation4b"></a><a
href="#footnote4b" class="citation">[4b]</a> to be a naturalised
plant.</p>
<p>Then follow in order the flowers of furze, hazel, winter
aconite (<i>Eranthis</i>), hellebore (<i>H. f&oelig;tidus</i>),
daisy, and snowdrop; so that the winter flowers make a most
pleasant show, and tempt us to raise January to the rank of the
first month of springtime&mdash;but we must allow the credit to
be justly due to winter.&nbsp; In winter, too, we must be
grateful to the ivy of the bare hedgerows shining in the sun, its
leaves glistening like the simple jewels of a savage.</p>
<p>With February, we are agreed that spring comes in, but it is a
springtime that keeps something of <!-- page 5--><a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>the graveness
of winter: though, when the silver sunshine begins to be
decorated with the singing of birds, we must call it spring.</p>
<p>In February, too, the roads are no longer edged with dead
white grass, but show the fresh green of wayside
plants&mdash;cow-weed, nettle, dock, and cleavers.</p>
<p>The trees still stand naked, their leaf-buds waiting for a
better season.&nbsp; I like to think of wintering plants not as
being asleep, but rather as silent.&nbsp; They sing with all
their green tongues when spring releases them from the cupboards
(which we call buds) where she has kept them safe.</p>
<p>The service-tree is a hardy creature, for its buds are naked
and unprotected, like Pampas Indians who are proud of sleeping
uncovered, and of seeing, as they rise, their forms outlined in
the hoar-frost.&nbsp; I have only recently noticed the purple
tint of alder-buds; <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a> and I am reminded of the character in
<i>Cranford</i>, who needs Tennyson&rsquo;s words &ldquo;Black as
ash-buds in March&rdquo; to teach him the fact.&nbsp; Some trees
show their flowers early.&nbsp; For instance, the hanging tassels
of the hazel, from which the dusty pollen can be shaken out, and
the tiny red tufts which are all the female flower has to
show.&nbsp; The alder, too, has a brave crowd of lambs&rsquo;
tails.&nbsp; The elm should flower about the middle of March, and
its pink stamens make a pleasant sight.&nbsp; These plants are
called anemophilous&mdash;that is, <i>wind-loving</i>, as though
grateful to the wind for carrying their <!-- page 6--><a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>pollen without
payment.&nbsp; I can imagine that the plants employing insects to
carry pollen from one to another feel superior to the
wind-fertilised clan.&nbsp; We may fancy the duckweed (speaking
of the pine) to say: &ldquo;Of course, he is very big and of an
ancient family, but for that very reason he is primitive in his
habits.&nbsp; I know he boasts that he employs the winds of
heaven as marriage priests, but we are served by the animal
kingdom in our unions&mdash;and that, you must allow, is
something to be proud of.&rdquo; <a name="citation6"></a><a
href="#footnote6" class="citation">[6]</a>&nbsp; But duckweeds
grow so crowded together that they are probably fertilised, to a
great extent, by contact with their neighbours, without aid from
the animal kingdom.&nbsp; We may also imagine the duckweed
reproving the pine for his extravagance in the matter of pollen
production.&nbsp; This, however, is necessary, because the pollen
being sown broadcast by the wind, it is a matter of chance
whether or not a grain reaches the stigma of its own species, and
the chance of its doing so is clearly increased by multiplying
the number of pollen-grains produced.&nbsp; Enormous quantities
of the precious dust are wasted by this prodigality.&nbsp; We
read of pollen swept from the decks of ships, or coating with a
yellow scum lakes hidden among Tyrolean pinewoods.&nbsp; Pollen
is so largely dispersed in the air that it has been supposed to
be a cause of hay-fever.</p>
<p>Blackley found, by means of a sticky plate, which <!-- page
7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>could be
exposed and covered again, when raised high in the air on a kite,
that pollen is dispersed to considerable altitudes.&nbsp;
Wherever vegetable <i>d&eacute;bris</i> collects, pollen-grains
may be found.&nbsp; Kerner found them, together with wind-borne
seeds and scales of butterflies&rsquo; wings, sticking to the ice
in remote Alpine glaciers.</p>
<p>Another characteristic of wind-borne pollen is dryness or
dustiness; the grains are smooth, not sculptured like the pollen
meant to be carried by insects; nor are they sticky or oily, as
is often the case with entomophilous pollen.&nbsp; The advantage
to the plan is obvious; the grains, from the absence of the
burr-like quality, or of any other kind of adhesiveness, do not
tend to hold together in clumps, but separate easily from one
another, and float all the more easily. <a
name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a></p>
<p>Several adaptations are found to favour the dispersal of the
pollen.&nbsp; Wind-fertilised plants are generally tall; thus in
Europe, at least, the commonest representatives of the class are
shrubs or trees&mdash;witness the fir-trees, yew, juniper, oak,
hazel, birch.&nbsp; And where the plants are
lowly&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, grasses and sedges, and the
plantains&mdash;the flowers are more or less raised up on the
haulm.&nbsp; An exception must be made of some
water-plants&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, the Potamogetons, where the
flower-stalk is but slightly raised above the surface.</p>
<p>Wind-fertilised plants have many characteristics which favour
the dispersal of the pollen.&nbsp; The grasses <!-- page 8--><a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>have long
pendent stamens, and versatile anthers, from which the pollen is
easily shaken out by the wind.&nbsp; There are, of course,
exceptions to these generalisations.&nbsp; Such plants as
Hippuris and Salicornia have no particular adaptations: the
filaments are short, and the plants themselves are not of
sufficient height to be able to scatter forth their pollen
efficiently by the mere bending of their stems.&nbsp; The need
for exposure to the wind is shown in another way&mdash;namely, by
the habit of the Cupulifer&aelig; (oak, hazel, etc.), of
flowering before the leaves appear; this not only favours the
start of the pollen on its flight, but is probably still more
useful in increasing its chance of reaching the stigma.</p>
<p>If the pollen is exposed to the wind it will be liable to be
wetted and injured.&nbsp; Catkins&mdash;such as those of the
walnut or hazel&mdash;give some protection to the pollen, since
the stamens are covered in by tile-like scales; but
where&mdash;as in the grasses and plantains&mdash;the anthers
hang far out of the flowers, the pollen is easily injured.&nbsp;
Some of the cereals protect themselves against injury by means of
a remarkably rapid growth of the filaments; thus the anthers
remain hidden within the flowers until the last moment, and,
under the influence of a warm sunny morning, rapidly protrude
themselves.&nbsp; If the scales of the flower are artificially
separated, the growth can be produced by warmth and moisture;
Askenasy describes a trick of country children, who put ears of
rye in their mouths and thus produce a miraculous growth of
stamens.&nbsp; The growth or rapid turgescence takes place,
according to the same <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>writer, at the pace of one millimetre
in three minutes.</p>
<p>The explosive male flowers of the nettle have a somewhat
similar meaning.&nbsp; The young stamen is bent so that the upper
end of the anther touches the base of the filament.&nbsp; On the
inner concave side of the stamen are large cells, whose
turgescence tends to unfold the filament: I do not know by what
means the unfolding is prevented, but whatever the cause may be,
it is at last overcome and the stamen uncurls with a jerk, and
scatters forth the pollen.&nbsp; Here, as in the rye, the pollen
is protected until the actual moment when it starts on its voyage
through the air.</p>
<p>Another of the Nettle tribe, <i>Pilea
serpyllifolia</i>&mdash;a plant often cultivated in our
greenhouses&mdash;is also explosive, and its little puffs of
smoke-like pollen have gained for it the popular name of the
artillery plant.&nbsp; Its power of explosion must be of value to
it as counterbalancing the disadvantage, to a wind-fertilised
plant, of such a lowly habit.</p>
<p>The adaptations found in the female organs are chiefly such as
increase the surface capable of receiving the pollen, and
therefore increase the chance of fertilisation.&nbsp; A big
stigmatic surface is common: not only is the receptive part of
the style large, but it usually bears very large stigmatic
papill&aelig;, which gives a velvety hoary look to this type of
stigma.&nbsp; In the grasses the three divisions of the stigma
are always more or less conspicuous; and reach a climax, in this
respect, in the huge beard-like tangle of the maize.</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>Some of the most interesting cases of wind fertilisation
are those in which an isolated instance occurs in a Natural Order
otherwise served by insects.&nbsp; Thus in the Rosace&aelig;,
<i>Poterium sanguisorba</i> is wind fertilised, and has long
pendent stamens, and a tufted stigma; while the closely allied
<i>Sanguisorba officinalis</i>, although it secretes nectar (and
this can only mean that it hopes to attract insects), retains the
tufted stigma of its anemophilous relatives.</p>
<p>In the case of the Kerguelen cabbage (<i>Pringlea
antiscorbutica</i>), the cause of its degeneration seems to be
the want of winged insects on the wind-blown shores on which it
grows.&nbsp; It has acquired some anemophilous
characters&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, increased stigmatic surface and
exserted anthers.&nbsp; Its flowers are inconspicuous like those
of wind-fertilised plants in general, and it seems in fair way to
lose its petals altogether&mdash;many flowers only retaining a
single one.&nbsp; The entomophilous ancestry of Pringlea is
clearly shown by the occasional remnants of coloured markings in
the petals, like those which in other flowers serve as
finger-posts to visiting-insects, and are called
nectar-guides.</p>
<p>But these are digressions&mdash;sidepaths of tempting detail
which have lured me from the straight highway.&nbsp; However,
they have brought me back to the main road.</p>
<p>In Blomefield&rsquo;s <i>Observations in Natural History</i>
(p. 332), he points out that &ldquo;however much the seasons may
differ in different years, the phenomena generally follow one
another in the same order.&nbsp; And it follows that those which
occur together any <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>one year, will occur at or nearly
[at] the same time every other.&rdquo;&nbsp; This indeed is what
we might expect, from the circumstances of any interruption in
the time of their occurrence, due to seasonal influence,
necessarily affecting them all equally.&nbsp; One of the examples
by which he supports his view is the parallel behaviour of the
ground-ivy (<i>Nepeta Glechoma</i>) and the box-tree, whose
flowers appear simultaneously on 3rd April, as an average date;
while in a certain backward year they flowered later, but still
close together&mdash;namely, 20th April and 19th April.&nbsp;
There is to me an especial charm in these duets.&nbsp; Thus I
like to imagine that the larch is waiting to put on its new green
clothes till it hears the black-cap.&nbsp; Or is it that the
larch rules the orchestra, and with his green baton signals to
the songster to strike into the symphony? <a
name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a></p>
<p>Shakespeare is right to make the daffodil come before the
swallow dares, since according to Blomefield the average of
seventeen annual observations gives 12th March for the
daffodil&rsquo;s flowering-day, and the swallow does not appear
till 9th April at the earliest.&nbsp; Browning, too, is
scientifically safe in letting his chaffinch sing now &ldquo;that
the lowest boughs and the brushwood sheaf round the elm-tree bole
are in tiny leaf.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed, the most dilatory
chaffinch must have been singing since 19th February, and in
fortunate seasons might have been heard on 7th January.&nbsp; A
floral calendar may be useful as an interpreter in antiquarian
problems.&nbsp; Thus <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Blomefield <a
name="citation12a"></a><a href="#footnote12a"
class="citation">[12a]</a> says that &ldquo;the
<i>flos-cuculi</i>, or cuckoo-flower of the older botanists, was
so called from its opening its flowers about the time of the
cuckoo&rsquo;s commencing his call.&rdquo;&nbsp; The botanist
referred to may have been Gerarde, and the flower seems to be
<i>Cardamine pratensis</i>, known as lady&rsquo;s smock, also as
the cuckoo-flower.&nbsp; Now the cuckoo begins his song (as the
average of Blomefield&rsquo;s seventeen years&rsquo; observation
near Cambridge) on 29th April, <a name="citation12b"></a><a
href="#footnote12b" class="citation">[12b]</a> and lady&rsquo;s
smock blossoms 19th April. <a name="citation12c"></a><a
href="#footnote12c" class="citation">[12c]</a>&nbsp; The
coincidence is but moderate, but it is cheering to find in
Gilbert White&rsquo;s <i>Calendar</i>, with its earlier South
Country dates, that the events occur together: lady&rsquo;s
smock, 6th to 20th April; cuckoo, 7th to 26th April.</p>
<p>Wood-sorrel (<i>Oxalis acetosella</i>) was known as
cuckoo-sorrel by the Saxons.&nbsp; In Stillingfleet&rsquo;s
<i>Calendar of Flora</i> (1755), it is said to flower on 16th
April, and the cuckoo to begin his song on 17th April.&nbsp; It
is pleasant to find, in a Swedish calendar of flora, that the
cuckoo sings on 12th May, and the wood-sorrel flowers on 13th
May.&nbsp; <i>Lychnis flos-cuculi</i>, the ragged robin, flowers
on 19th May, and seems to have no kind of right to the name of a
cuckoo-flower, though Gerarde remarks that it &ldquo;flowers in
April and May, when the cuckoo doth begin to sing her pleasant
notes without stammering.&rdquo; <a name="citation12d"></a><a

13</span>I remember being told by a physician that a celebrated
Polish violinist in his old age could not bear the sound of
concerted music, but he would weep over a musical score of which
he said, &ldquo;These beggars don&rsquo;t play out of
tune.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is also true of the great symphony of
colour which the springtime unfolds.&nbsp; The trees are
double-basses, and doubtless some are contra-fagotti, though I
confess that I cannot speak positively on this point.&nbsp; Then
come a mass of beautiful shrub-like plants which make up the rest
of the string-band.&nbsp; As one who loves wind-instruments, I
like to think that the flutes, oboes, and clarinets are the
flowers of my vernal orchestra, decorating the great mass of
stringed instruments with streaks and flames of colour.</p>
<p>In real music, we cannot say why certain sounds make an
appropriate opening for a symphony; nor can we understand why the
chorus of flowers should (as above pointed out) be led by
mezereon (<i>Daphne mezereum</i>), followed by furze, hazel, the
daisy, and the snowdrop.</p>
<p>Of course, their dates are not rigorously fixed: the plants
just referred to vary in their dates of flowering in the
following way:</p>
<p class="gutindent">Mezereon, 11th January to 2nd February;</p>
<p class="gutindent">Furze, 1st January to 4th April;</p>
<p class="gutindent">Hazel, 1st January to 20th February;</p>
<p class="gutindent">Snowdrop, 18th January to 16th February;</p>
<p>the mean dates being: mezereon, 22nd January; furze, 24th
January; hazel, 26th January; snowdrop, 30th January.&nbsp; One
cause of variation in the date <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>of flowering
is temperature, and in the early months of the year this is
probably the principal cause.&nbsp; Temperature must in the same
way affect the flowering of summer plants, though the result is
not so striking as in the springtime.&nbsp; In my article
&ldquo;A Procession of Flowers&rdquo; (in this volume) I have
given the range of the dates of flowering for different
months.</p>
<p>The spring is the happiest season for those who love plants,
who delight to watch and record the advent of old friends as the
great procession of green leaves and beautiful flowers unwinds
itself with a glory which no familiarity can tarnish.</p>
<p>I cannot resist giving the names of some of the flowers that
make this familiar show that February and March give us.&nbsp;
Field-speedwell (<i>Veronica agrestis</i>), butcher&rsquo;s
broom, <i>Pyrus japonica</i>, primrose, red dead-nettle, crocus,
dandelion, periwinkle, celandine, marsh-marigold, sweet violet,
ivy-leaved veronica, daffodil, white dead-nettle,
colt&rsquo;s-foot (<i>Tussilago farfara</i>), dog&rsquo;s
mercury, buttercup (<i>Ranunculus repens</i>), hyacinth,
almond-tree, gooseberry, wood-sorrel, ground-ivy,
wall-flower.&nbsp; The order in which they occur is taken from
the mean dates of flowering given by Blomefield.&nbsp; To a lover
of plants, this commonplace list will, I hope, be what a score is
to a musician, and will recall to him some of the charm of the
orchestra of living beauty that springtime awakens.</p>

15</span>SOME NAMES OF CHARACTERS IN FICTION <a
name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a></h2>
<p>To some readers the personality of the characters in fiction
is everything, and the names under which they appear of no
importance.&nbsp; This is doubtless a rational position, but to
me, and I think to many other novel-readers, the names which our
imaginary friends and enemies bear is a matter of the greatest
interest.&nbsp; To us it seems unbearable to have a Mr B. as a
principal character, and the same objection applies to the names
of places&mdash;&ldquo;the little town of C. near the cathedral
town of D.&rdquo; is too depressing.&nbsp; Trollope, who does not
rank high as a name-artist, entirely satisfies us with his
Barchester and its Bishop Proudie and Archdeacon Grantley.&nbsp;
George Eliot, too, has been able in the case of Stonyshire and
Loamshire to give convincing names to counties, and never offends
in the names of her characters, though they have no especial
attractiveness.</p>
<p>In some cases it is hard to say whether or no a given name is
appropriate.&nbsp; In Jane Austen&rsquo;s books, for instance, we
have grown up in familiarity with the characters and we cannot
associate them with others.&nbsp; It would be unbearable to have
Emma&rsquo;s <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>lover called Mr William Larkins and
his servant George Knightley.&nbsp; And this is not merely the
result of old acquaintance; there is, I cannot doubt, a real
dignity in one name and a touch of comedy in the other.&nbsp; For
this statement one can but rely on instinct, but a real William
Larkins (and I must apologise to him if he exists) will doubtless
take a different view of the matter.</p>
<p>But Jane Austen, like George Eliot, makes no pretence to be an
artist in nomenclature.&nbsp; She merely aims, I imagine, at
names which, without being colourless, are free from meaning and
in every way possible.</p>
<p>Thackeray is the outstanding instance of a novelist who makes
a fine-art of nomenclature.&nbsp; With him there is an obvious
delight in coining names.&nbsp; Thus there would be no harm in
Clive Newcome going to Windsor and Newton&rsquo;s shop to buy
paint brushes, but Thackeray sends him to Messrs Soap and
Isaac&mdash;a parody of that highly respectable firm which always
pleases me.</p>
<p>I have with some little labour made a rough index of <i>Vanity
Fair</i>, and I find in the second volume (which is probably a
fair sample of the names in the whole book) that there are 247
names.&nbsp; The author evidently takes a delight in their
invention.&nbsp; For instance, at one of Becky&rsquo;s great
dinner parties (vol. ii., p. 172), the eminent guests who come in
after dinner are principally cheeses <a name="citation16"></a><a
href="#footnote16" class="citation">[16]</a>&mdash;Duchess
(Dowager) of Stilton, Duc de la Gruy&egrave;re, Marchioness of
Cheshire, Marchese Alessandro Strachino, Comte <!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>de la Brie,
Baron Schapzuger.&nbsp; The list also contains the name of
Chevalier Tosti, who, I take it, is toasted cheese.</p>
<p>The titles he gives to business firms are not always
complimentary.&nbsp; For instance, we have (vol. ii., p. 283) the
case of poor Mr Scape, who was ruined by entering the great
Calcutta house of Fogle, <a name="citation17a"></a><a
href="#footnote17a" class="citation">[17a]</a> Fake and
Cracksman.&nbsp; Both Fogle and Fake had left the firm with large
fortunes, &ldquo;and Sir Horace Fogle is about to be raised to
the peerage as Baron Bandanna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A similar type of name is the title of Becky&rsquo;s
solicitors, Messrs Burke, Thurtell and Hayes, <a
name="citation17b"></a><a href="#footnote17b"
class="citation">[17b]</a> who forced the Insurance Company to
pay the amount for which poor Jos Sedley&rsquo;s life had been
insured (vol. ii., p. 391).&nbsp; It is interesting to find (vol.
ii., p. 341) that the author introduces himself in the person of
Mr Frederick Pigeon, who &ldquo;lost eight <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>hundred
pounds to Major Loder and the Honourable Mr
Deuceace.&rdquo;&nbsp; This may remind us of Thackeray&rsquo;s
own loss of &pound;1500 in a similar way (<i>Dict. of Nat.
Biog.</i>).&nbsp; In some instances the author evidently could
not take the trouble to coin effective names, as for instance in
his reference to the firm of Jones, Brown and Robinson <a
name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18"
class="citation">[18]</a> (vol. ii., p. 130).&nbsp; A member of
this firm became 1st Baron Helverlyn, when he altered his name to
Johnes.&nbsp; His unfortunate daughter became the wife of Lord
Gaunt.&nbsp; The subsidiary titles of this nobleman are
pleasant&mdash;Viscount Hellborough, Baron Pitchley and
Grillsby.</p>
<p>Other firms are represented as purely Jewish, <i>e.g.</i>, Mr
Lewis representing Mr Davids, and Mr Moss acting for Mr Manasseh,
who complimented Becky &ldquo;upon the brilliant way in which she
did business&rdquo; when she was making arrangements for
Rawdon&rsquo;s debts (vol. ii., p. 10).</p>
<p>There are many good names of shady people, <i>e.g.</i>, Lady
Crackenbury (vol. ii., p. 140), whom Becky cut, and Mrs
Washington White, to whom she &ldquo;gave the go-by in the
Ring&rdquo;; Mrs Chippenham (p. 160) and Mme de la
Cruchecass&eacute;e are of the same type.&nbsp; There is also
Lady Slingstone, who said that Lord Steyne was &ldquo;really too
bad,&rdquo; but she went to his party.</p>
<p>Among the virtuous folks, I am particularly fond of Sir Lapin
Warren (vol. i., p. 207), whose lady was about to present him
with a thirteenth child.&nbsp; A variant occurs in vol. ii., p.
286, where we read of <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>&ldquo;thirteen sisters, daughters of
a country curate, the Rev. Felix Rabbits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One might quote names for ever, but I must be satisfied with
but a few more.</p>
<p>Among the professionally religious folks we have Rev. Lawrence
Grills.&nbsp; Among the fashionables Lady FitzWillis of the
Kingstreet family; Major-General and Lady Grizzel Macbeth (she
had been Lady G. Glowry, daughter of Lord Grey of Glowry <a
name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19"
class="citation">[19]</a>); and Mrs Hook Eagles, who patronised
Becky.</p>
<p>Names that seem to me bad are Fitzoof, Lord Heehaw&rsquo;s
son, Mrs Mantrap, and Lord Claude Lollypop.&nbsp; But there are
innumerable other good ones: Macmurdo, who was to have been
Rawdon&rsquo;s second in a duel with Lord Steyne; Captain
Papillon of the Guards, attending the young wife of old
Methuselah (a bad name); young May and his bride, &ldquo;Mrs
Winter that was, and who had been at school with May&rsquo;s
grandmother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Viscount Paddington was a guest at Becky&rsquo;s &ldquo;select
party&rdquo; in May Fair.&nbsp; Finally, the Earl of Portansherry
and the Prince of the house of Potztausand-Donnerwetter are good
although obvious.</p>
<p>In <i>Pendennis</i> are many good names.&nbsp; Major Pendennis
was proud of having made up the quarrel between Lady Clapperton
and her daughter Lady Claudia.&nbsp; Lady John Turnbull, who
spoke such bad French.&nbsp; Mr Kewsy, the barrister.&nbsp; Mr
Sibwright, the luxurious young man in whose vacant chamber Laura
Bell slept during Pendennis&rsquo; illness.&nbsp; The best of all
<!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>names must be given in Morgan&rsquo;s own words,
&ldquo;Lord de la Pole, sir, gave him [a valet] to his nephew
young Lord Cubley, and he have been with him on his foring tour,
and not wishing to go to Fitzurse Castle, etc., etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I must reluctantly leave Thackeray and consider a very
different maker of names, namely Dickens.&nbsp; It is sometimes
said that his names are not invented but discovered by
research.&nbsp; In my son Bernard&rsquo;s <i>A Dickens
Pilgrimage</i> (<i>Times</i> Series, 1914), he writes, p. 22:
&ldquo;Other people have been before us in seeing that Mr Jasper
keeps a shop in the High Street of Rochester,&rdquo; and that
&ldquo;Dorretts and Pordages are buried under the shadow of the
cathedral.&rdquo;&nbsp; He claims as his own the discovery that
in the churchyard of Chalk (near Rochester) there are
&ldquo;three tombstones standing almost next door to one another
and bearing a trinity of immortal names, Twist, Flight, and
Guppy.&rdquo;&nbsp; He adds that &ldquo;the lady in <i>Bleak
House</i> spelt her name Flite.&rdquo;&nbsp; I fail to believe
that anybody was ever called Pumblechook, and there are others
equally impossible.&nbsp; But the great name of Pickwick is not
an invention.&nbsp; Mr Percy Fitzgerald <a
name="citation20"></a><a href="#footnote20"
class="citation">[20]</a> gives plenty of evidence on this point,
in a discussion suggested by the sacred name being inscribed on
the Bath coach, to Sam Weller&rsquo;s indignation.&nbsp; There
was, for instance, a Mr William Pickwick of Bath, who died in
1795.&nbsp; Again, in 1807, the driver of &ldquo;Mr
Pickwick&rsquo;s coach . . . was taken suddenly and very
alarmingly ill on Slanderwick Common.&rdquo;&nbsp; One member of
the family &ldquo;entered the army, and for some reason changed
his name <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>to Sainsbury.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
object, as Mr Fitzgerald points out, is obvious enough.&nbsp; Mr
Fitzgerald mentions (p. 16) the curious fact that Mr Dickens (the
son of the author) once had to announce that he meant to call Mr
Pickwick as a witness in a case he was conducting.&nbsp; The
Judge made the characteristic remark, &ldquo;Pickwick is a very
appropriate character to be called by Dickens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With regard to the name Winkle, I cannot agree with Mr
Fitzgerald <a name="citation21"></a><a href="#footnote21"
class="citation">[21]</a> that Dickens took it from Washington
Irving&rsquo;s <i>Rip Van Winkle</i>.</p>
<p>Among the few names taken from real people is that of Mr
Justice Stareleigh, who is generally believed to be Mr Justice
Gaselee.</p>
<p>Sergeant Buzfuz in the same trial is believed on the authority
of Mr Bompas to be Serjeant Bompas, the father of that eminent
Q.C., but there seems to be no evidence that it is a
portrait.&nbsp; In <i>Pickwick</i> some of the best names are
those of various business firms, <i>e.g.</i>, Bilson and Slum,
who were Tom Smart&rsquo;s employers.&nbsp; In the Judge&rsquo;s
chambers (which &ldquo;are said to be of specially dirty
appearance&rdquo;) was a crowd of unfortunate clerks
&ldquo;waiting to attend summonses their employers had taken out,
which it was optional to the attorney on the opposite side to
attend or not, and whose business it was from time to time to cry
out the opposite attorney&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; For example,
leaning against the wall . . . was an office lad of fourteen with
a tenor voice; near him a common law clerk with a bass one.&nbsp;
A clerk hurried in with a bundle of papers and stared about
him.</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sniggle and Blink,&rsquo; cried the
tenor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Porkin and Snob,&rsquo; growled the bass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Stumpy and Deacon,&rsquo; said the
newcomer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These are fairly good names, though they have not the touch of
Thackeray.&nbsp; I like the names of the chief heroes in the
cricket match at Dingley Dell.&nbsp; Dumpkins and Podder went in
first for All-Muggleton, the bowlers on the other side being
Struggles and Luffey.&nbsp; These names are so familiar that it
is hard to judge them, but on the whole they seem to me fairly
good, as being slightly comic and not impossible.&nbsp; But when
we come to Horatio Fizkin, Esq., of Fizkin Lodge, and Hon. Samuel
Slumkey, of Slumkey Hall, we are indeed depressed.&nbsp; But
there are worse names in <i>Pickwick</i>.&nbsp; When Mrs Nupkins
and her daughter have discovered Captain Fitz-Marshall to be a
scamp: &ldquo;How can we ever show ourselves in society?&rdquo;
said Miss Nupkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How can we face the Porkenhams?&rsquo; cried Mrs
Nupkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Or the Griggs?&rsquo; cried Miss Nupkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Or the Slummintowkens?&rsquo; cried Mrs
Nupkins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last seems to me about as bad a name as any writer ever
invented.&nbsp; But Nockemorf, the name of Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s
predecessor in the apothecary business, is almost equally
tiresome in a different style.</p>
<p>Why he chose such names it is hard to say, since he certainly
could invent improbable names which are nevertheless
appropriate.&nbsp; For instance, Smangle and Mivins are quite
good names for the offensive scamps on whom Mr Pickwick is
&ldquo;chummed&rdquo; in the Fleet Prison.</p>
<p><!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>Daniel Grummer, the name of Mr Nupkins&rsquo; tipstaff,
is roughly of the same type, and Wilkins Flasher, as an
objectionable stockbroker is called, is quite a passable
name.&nbsp; The only name in <i>Pickwick</i> which is comparable
to those of Thackeray is Mrs Leo Hunter, while Count Smorltork,
who occurs in the same scene, is unbearable.&nbsp; On the other
hand, Captain Boldwig is quite a good name.</p>
<p>I now pass to Sir Walter Scott.&nbsp; It must be confessed
that in the two books chosen for analysis&mdash;<i>Guy
Mannering</i> and <i>The Antiquary</i>&mdash;he is disappointing
as an artist in nomenclature.&nbsp; To begin with <i>Guy
Mannering</i>, it is impossible to imagine why he gave such a
name as Meg Merrilies to his magnificent heroine.&nbsp; It
suggests &ldquo;merry lies,&rdquo; and makes us suspect that she
was originally intended for a comic character. <a
name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23"
class="citation">[23]</a>&nbsp; And why, as she grew into a
tragedy queen, he did not rename her I cannot understand.&nbsp;
Fortunately he gave the colourless name Abel Sampson to another
great character&mdash;the immortal Dominie.&nbsp; Again Dirk
Hatteraick is a passable name.&nbsp; I cannot pretend to say
whether it is a Dutch name, but as Dirk uses German (of a sort)
when not speaking English, we may leave the question open.&nbsp;
Among the names which are clearly bad are: Sir Thomas
Kittlecourt, John Featherhead, Sloethorn (a wine merchant),
Mortcloke the undertaker, Quid the tobacconist, Protocol the
lawyer, and lastly the MacDingawaies, a Highland sept or
clan.</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>The following seem to be bearable or fairly good, but I
must confess to a want of instinct as to Scotch names: MacGuffog,
a constable, Macbriar, Dandy Dinmont (although a <i>dinmont</i>
is the Scottish for &ldquo;a wedder in the second year&rdquo;),
MacCandlish.&nbsp; On the whole, as far as <i>Guy Mannering</i>
is concerned, the author gets but few good marks and many bad
ones.</p>
<p>The same is, I fear, true of <i>The Antiquary</i>.&nbsp; We
find such bad names as Rev. Mr Blattergowl of Trotcosey (vol. i.,
p. 208); Baron von Blunderhaus; Dibble the gardener;
Dousterswivel, the German or Dutch swindler; the Earl of
Glengibber; Goldiword, a moneylender; Dr Heavysterne, from the
Low Countries; Mr Mailsetter of the Post Office; Sandie
Netherstanes the miller; Jonathan Oldbuck, the hero of the book;
Sir Peter Pepperbrand of Glenstirym.&nbsp; Of the name
Strathtudlem I cannot judge; it does not strike me as good,
though possibly better than the immortal Tillietudlem of <i>Old
Mortality</i>.</p>
<p>There are, of course, a number of names which do not offend,
but there are few which are actually attractive.&nbsp; Among the
last-named class are Edie Ochiltree, Francis of Fowlsheugh,
Elspeth of Craigburnfoot, Lady Glenallan, Francie Macraw, Ailison
Breck, but among these Edie Ochiltree is the only name which is
undoubtedly in Class I.</p>
<p>It is disappointing to a lover of Sir Walter Scott to be
obliged to show that as an artist in names he ranks low.&nbsp;
But his sense of humour occasionally fails in other
matters.&nbsp; I remember being reproved (when a young man at
Cambridge) for saying that Scott showed a want of humour in
Jeanie Deans&rsquo; <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>letter to her father, in which she
tells him that Effie has been pardoned.&nbsp; The author
introduces in brackets: &ldquo;Here follow some observations
respecting the breed of cattle, and the produce of the dairy
which it is our intention to forward to the Board of
Agriculture.&rdquo;&nbsp; I still think I was right, and that the
eminent person who snubbed me was wrong.</p>
<p>Among the works of more modern writers I have analysed one of
Trollope&rsquo;s&mdash;the <i>Small House at Allington</i>.&nbsp;
The names on the whole are harmless and normal, such as
Christopher Dale of Allington; Adolphus Crosbie, the bad hero;
Montgomerie Dobbs, his friend; Fothergill, factotum to the Duke
of Omnium, and many others.&nbsp; Some names are only saved by
our familiarity with them, <i>e.g.</i>, Lady Dumbello or the
above-mentioned Duke of Omnium. <a name="citation25"></a><a
href="#footnote25" class="citation">[25]</a>&nbsp; Among the
fanciful names Mr Fanfaron and Major Fiasco are in the bad rather
than in the good class, though if they had more appropriateness
they might be passed.</p>
<p>The positively bad names are numerous enough&mdash;the Marquis
of Auldreekie; Basil and Pigskin, who keep a leather warehouse;
Sir Raffle Buffle; Chumpend, a butcher; Lady Clandidlem; the Rev.
John Joseph Jones is damned because he, an obvious Welshman, is
described as of Jesus College at Cambridge instead of
Oxford.&nbsp; Kissing and Love, two clerks in Johnny Eames&rsquo;
office, might have been passed had not the author gone out of his
way to refer to the lamentable jokes made in the office about
them.&nbsp; Mr Optimist is an incredibly bad <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>name, and the
same may be said of Sir Constant Outonites.&nbsp; The physician,
Sir Omicron Pi, <a name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26"
class="citation">[26]</a> may have a meaning of which I am
ignorant.&nbsp; I think Thackeray would have spelled it Sir
O&rsquo;Micron Pye, which would have given a touch of
reality.</p>
<p>There is one class of books which I have not noticed, namely,
those in which all or nearly all the characters have names with
an obvious meaning.&nbsp; The great instance of this type is
Bunyan&rsquo;s <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>, in which occur
well-known names such as Mr Worldly Wiseman, Faithful, Mr
Facing-both-Ways, Lord Desire-of-Vain-Glory, etc.&nbsp; There are
two exceptions in <i>The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>, namely
Demas, which is taken from 2 Timothy iv. 10, and Mnason (Acts
xxi. 16).</p>
<p>An author of this type, with whom Bunyan would have objected
to be classed, is Sheridan.&nbsp; In <i>The Rivals</i> we have
the immortal names of Sir Anthony Absolute, Sir Lucius
O&rsquo;Trigger, Mrs Malaprop, and Lydia Languish.&nbsp; Bob
Acres has not so obvious a meaning, but is clearly meant to imply
rusticity.&nbsp; The chief exception is Faulkland, and there are
also David, Julia, and Lucy.</p>
<p>In <i>St Patrick&rsquo;s Day</i> we have Dr Rosy, Justice
Credulous, Sergeant Trounce, Corporal Flint.&nbsp; The hero,
Lieutenant O&rsquo;Connor, is the principal exception.</p>
<p>Finally, in <i>The School for Scandal</i>, we have Sir Peter
Teazle (which suggests a prickly irritable nature), as well as
names with a more obvious <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>meaning,
<i>e.g.</i>, Joseph Surface, Sir Benjamin Backbite, Snake,
Careless, Sir Harry Bumper, Lady Sneerwell, and Mrs Candour.</p>
<p>The other characters have names without meanings, <i>e.g.</i>,
Rowley, Moses, Trip, and Maria.&nbsp; The fact that the very
different characters, Charles and Joseph Surface, necessarily
bear the same surname shows how difficult it is to carry out a
system such as that on which Sheridan&rsquo;s nomenclature is
based.</p>

29</span>THOMAS HEARNE, 1678&ndash;1735</h2>
<p>To the everyday reader Thomas Hearne, if at all, is chiefly
known by the Diary which he kept for thirty years, viz., from
1705 when he was twenty-seven years of age, until his
death.&nbsp; This, in 145 volumes, is preserved in the Bodleian
Library, and is, I believe, in course of publication.&nbsp; What
I have to say is founded on Bliss&rsquo;s <i>Reliqui&aelig;
Hearnian&aelig;</i>, <a name="citation29a"></a><a
href="#footnote29a" class="citation">[29a]</a> which consists of
extracts from the above-mentioned diary.&nbsp; Mr Bliss naturally
selected passages referring to well-known books or persons of
note; but he was wise enough to include what a pompous editor
would have omitted as trifling.&nbsp; It is these which are
especially valuable to one who tries to give a picture of
Hearne&rsquo;s simple and lovable character.</p>
<p>The following account of Thomas Hearne, written by himself, is
from the Appendix to vol. i. of <i>The Lives of John Leland</i>,
<i>Thomas Hearne</i>, <i>and Anthony &agrave; Wood</i>, 1772. <a
name="citation29b"></a><a href="#footnote29b"
class="citation">[29b]</a></p>
<p>Thomas was the son of George Hearne, Parish Clerk of White
Waltham, Berks.&nbsp; He was born at Littlefield Green
&ldquo;within the said parish of White <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>Waltham.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thomas, &ldquo;being naturally
inclined to Learning, he soon became Master of the English
Tongue.&rdquo; <a name="citation30a"></a><a href="#footnote30a"
class="citation">[30a]</a></p>
<p>Even when a boy Hearne was &ldquo;much talked of,&rdquo; and
this &ldquo;occasioned that Learned Gentleman, Francis Cherry, <a
name="citation30b"></a><a href="#footnote30b"
class="citation">[30b]</a> Esq., to put him to the Free School of
Bray <a name="citation30c"></a><a href="#footnote30c"
class="citation">[30c]</a> in Berks on purpose to learn the Latin
Tongue, which his Father was not entirely Master of; this was
about the beginning of the year 1693.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not
only the Master himself, but all the other Boys had a very
particular Respect for him, and could not but admire and applaud
his Industry and Application.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Cherry being fully satisfied of the great and
surprising Progress he had made, by the advice of that good and
learned Man Mr Dodwell (who then <!-- page 31--><a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>lived at
Shottesbrooke), he resolved to take him into his own House, which
accordingly he did about Easter in 1795 <a
name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31"
class="citation">[31]</a> and provided for him as if he had been
his own Son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Easter Term 1696 he began life at Oxford as a Batteler
of Edmund Hall, where he was soon employed by the Principal in
the &ldquo;learned Works in which he was engaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as ever Mr Hearne had taken the Degree of
Batchelor of Arts [in Act Term 1699] he constantly went to the
Bodleian Library every day, and studied there as long as the time
allowed by the Statutes would admit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This led to his being appointed Assistant Keeper of the
Bodleian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being settled in this employment, it is incredible what
Pains he took in regulating the Library, in order to which he
examined all the printed Books in it, comparing every Volume with
Catalogue set out many years before by Dr Hyde.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
seems that this was very imperfect, and Hearne supplied a new
catalogue.&nbsp; He afterwards dealt with the MSS. and the
collection of coins.</p>
<p>In 1703 he took his M.A., and was offered Chaplaincies at two
Colleges, but was not allowed to accept either of them.&nbsp; In
1712 he became &ldquo;Second Keeper&rdquo; of the Library.&nbsp;
This position he accepted on condition that he might still be
Janitor without the salary attaching to that position.&nbsp; He
desired to retain the office because it gave him access to the
Library at all hours.&nbsp; In 1713 he declined the Librarianship
of the Royal Society.</p>
<p><!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>In January 1714/15 his troubles began with his election
as &ldquo;Architypographus and Superior or Esque Beadle in Civil
Law.&rdquo;&nbsp; But after he had been elected, the
Vice-Chancellor appointed, as Architypographus, a common printer,
and Hearne resigned the Beadleship, but &ldquo;continued to
execute the office of librarian as long as he could obtain access
to the library; but on 23rd January 1716, the last day fixed by
the new Act for taking the oaths to the Hanoverian Dynasty, he
was actually prevented from entering the library, and soon after
formally deprived of his office on the ground of &lsquo;neglect
of duty&rsquo;&rdquo; (<i>Dict. Nat. Biog.</i>).</p>
<p>It is not necessary to follow in detail the ill-usage he
received.&nbsp; He was afterwards treated with more
consideration.&nbsp; Thus in 1720 it appears that he might have
had the Camden Professorship of History, but again the oaths
stood in his way.&nbsp; He also declined the living of Bletchley
in Buckinghamshire.&nbsp; In 1729 he refused to be a candidate
for the place of Chief Keeper of the Bodleian Library.&nbsp; In
his own words &ldquo;he retired to Edmund-Hall, and lived there
very privately . . . furnishing himself with Books, partly from
his Study, and partly by the help of friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is evident that his literary work was well remunerated,
because a &ldquo;sum of money amounting to upwards of one
thousand Pounds was found in his Room after his
decease.&rdquo;&nbsp; This statement, together with the date of
his death (10th June 1735), are clearly part of the design to
conceal the authorship of the biography.</p>
<p><!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>In the following pages I have chosen what seem to me to
be interesting extracts from Hearne&rsquo;s Diary, which begins
4th July 1705, and concludes 1st June 1735.&nbsp; I shall give
what especially illustrates the conditions of life at Oxford from
the beginning of the eighteenth century until the date of the
author&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>There was plenty of barbarism remaining in Oxford life, for
instance, 4th September 1705:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Book called <i>The Memorial</i> was burnt last
Saturday at the Sessions house, by the hands of the common
hang-man, and this week the same will be done at the Royal
Exchange and Palace-Yard, Westminster.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the same
month, however, we find pleasanter record, <i>e.g.</i>, the first
mention of one who (though I think they never met) became his
most valued correspondent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night I was with Mr Wotton (who writ the <i>Essay
on Ancient and Modern Learning</i>) at the tavern. . . .&nbsp; Mr
Wotton told me Mr Baker of St John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge,
had writ the history and antiquities of that college; and that he
is in every way qualified (being a very industrious and judicious
man) to write the hist. and antiq. of that university.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas Baker, b. 1656, d. 1740, was a Fellow of St
John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, but on the accession of George
I. he would not take the oath of allegiance and lost his
Fellowship.&nbsp; The College, however, treated him with
consideration and he was allowed to remain as a
<i>commoner-master</i> until his death.&nbsp; He worked
indefatigably, and gained the deserved <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>&ldquo;reputation of being inferior to no living English
scholar in his minute and extended acquaintance with the
antiquities of our national history&rdquo; (<i>Dict. Nat.
Biog.</i>).</p>
<p>There is often a pleasant irrelevance in Hearne&rsquo;s
Diary.&nbsp; For instance:&mdash;</p>
<p>18<i>th Oct.</i> 1705.&mdash;&ldquo;Mr Lesley was in the
public library this afternoon, with some Irish ladies.&nbsp; He
goes under the name of <i>Smith</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I like the following outburst on the value of
books:&mdash;</p>
<p>2<i>nd Nov.</i> 1705.&mdash;&ldquo;Narcissus March, Archbishop
of Armagh, gave 2500 libs for Bishop Stillingfleet&rsquo;s
library which, like that of Dr Isaac Vossius, was suffered to go
out of the nation to the eternal scandal and reproach of
it.&nbsp; The said archbishop has built a noble repository for
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>6<i>th Nov.</i> 1705.&mdash;&ldquo;Mr Pullen, of Magd. hall,
last night told me that there was once a very remarkable stone in
Magd. hall library, which was afterwards lent to Dr Plot, who
never returned it, replying, when he was asked for it, that
<i>&rsquo;twas a rule amongst antiquaries to receive</i>, <i>and
never restore</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the more reprehensible in Dr Plot (1640&ndash;1696)
inasmuch as he had been bred at Magdalen Hall.&nbsp; He was the
author of <i>A Natural History of Oxfordshire</i>, and also of
Staffordshire.&nbsp; The latter is apparently the better of the
two, but it does not speak well for his sources of information
that it should have been &ldquo;a boast among the Staffordshire
squires, to whom he addressed his enquiries, how readily they had
&lsquo;humbugged old <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>Plot.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; He was
appointed Secretary to the Royal Society in 1682.&nbsp; He was
also the first custos of Ashmole&rsquo;s Museum, which could not
have been an easy office since &ldquo;twelve cartloads of Trades
cant&rsquo;s rarities&rdquo; arrived in Oxford to form its
nucleus.&nbsp; (<i>Dict. Nat. Biog.</i>).</p>
<p>18<i>th Nov.</i> 1705.&mdash;&ldquo;When sir Godfrey Kneller
(as Dr Hudson informs me) came to Oxon, by Mr Pepys&rsquo;s
order, to draw Dr Wallis&rsquo;s picture, he, at dinner with Dr
Wallis, was pleased to say, upon the Dr&rsquo;s questioning the
<i>legitimacy of the prince of Wales</i>, that he did not in the
least doubt but he was the son of King James and queen Mary; and
to evince this he added, that upon the sight of the picture of
the prince of Wales, sent from Paris into England, he was fully
satisfied of what others seemed to doubt so much.&nbsp; For, as
he further said, he had manifest lines and features of both in
their faces, which he knew very well, having drawn them both
several times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>18<i>th Nov.</i> 1705.&mdash;&ldquo;After Mr Walker was turned
out of University coll. for being a papist, he lived obscurely in
London, his chief maintenance being from the contributions of
some of his old friends and acquaintance; amongst whom was Dr
Radcliff, who (out of a grateful remembrance of favours received
from him in the college) sent him once a year a new suit of
cloaths, with ten broad pieces, and a dozen bottles of the
richest Canary to support his drooping spirits.&nbsp; This, Dr
Hudson (from whom I received this story) was informed by Dr
Radcliff himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>9<i>th Dec.</i> 1705, p. 78.&mdash;&ldquo;To show that the
Dutchess <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>of Marlborough (commonly called
<i>Queen Zarah</i>) has the ascendant over the queen. . . .&nbsp;
When prince George (who is lookt upon as a man of little spirit
and understanding) sollicited the queen, his wife, for a place
for some friend of his, Zarah, who happened to be by at that
time, cryed out, <i>Christ</i>! <i>madam</i>! <i>I am promised it
before</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>30<i>th Jan.</i> 1705&ndash;6.&mdash;&ldquo;Mr Thwaits tells
me that the dean of Christ Church (Mr Aldrich) formerly drew up
an epitome of heraldry for the use of some young gentlemen under
his care. . . .&nbsp; He says &rsquo;twas done very well, and the
best in its nature ever made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>26<i>th April</i> 1705&ndash;6.&mdash;&ldquo;Mr Grabe created
D.D.; Dr Smalrich presented him with a cap, and after that with a
ring, signifying that the universitys of Oxford and Francfurt
were now joyned together, and become two sisters; and that they
might be the more firmly united together, as well in learning as
religion, he kissed Mr Grabe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is of interest as showing that the custom of giving rings
at the conferring of honorary degrees existed in England, as it
does to this day at Upsala.</p>
<p>The following extract illustrates what we should now consider
great license in the matter of smoking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the bill for security of the church of England was
read . . . Dr Bull sate in the lobby of the house of lords all
the while, smoking his pipe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>31<i>st March</i> 1708&ndash;9.&mdash;&ldquo;We hear from
Yeovill in Somersetshire by very good hands of a woman covered
with snow for at least a week.&nbsp; When found she told them
that she had layn very warm, and had slept most part of the
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>A well-known case of the same sort is described in
Gunning&rsquo;s <i>Reminiscences</i> (1854).</p>
<p>22<i>nd April</i> 1711.&mdash;&ldquo;There is a daily paper
comes out called <i>The Spectator</i>, written, as is supposed,
by the same hand that writ the <i>Tatler</i>, viz. Captain
Steel.&nbsp; In one of the last of these papers is a letter
written from Oxon, at four o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and
subscribed <i>Abraham Froth</i>.&nbsp; It ridicules our
hebdomadal meetings.&nbsp; The <i>Abraham Froth</i> is designed
for <i>Dr Arthur Charlett</i>, an empty, frothy man, and indeed
the letter personates him incomparably well, being written, as he
uses to do, upon great variety of things, and yet about nothing
of moment.&nbsp; Queen&rsquo;s people are angry at it, and the
common-room say there, &rsquo;tis silly, dull stuff; and they are
seconded by some that have been of the same college.&nbsp; But
men that are indifferent commend it highly, as it
deserves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>17<i>th Nov.</i> 1712.&mdash;&ldquo;On Thursday last (13th
Nov.), duke Hamilton and the Lord Mohun being before Mr Oillabar,
one of the masters of Chancery, about some suit depending between
them, and some words arising, a challenge was made between these
two noble men, and the duell was fought on Saturday (15th Nov.)
in the Park.&nbsp; My lord Mohun was killed on the spot, and the
duke so wounded that he died before he got home.&nbsp; This lord
Mohun should have been hanged some years agoe for murder, which
he had committed divers times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>24<i>th Nov.</i>&mdash;. . .&nbsp; &ldquo;The duke having
given Mohun his mortal wound, and taking him up in his arms, as
soon as Makartney saw it, he and col. Hamilton fell <!-- page
38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>to
it; but Hamilton, though he was wounded by Makartney in the leg,
disarmed Makartney, and threw his sword from him, and immediately
went to Mohun to endeavour also to recover him.&nbsp; Mean time
Makartney (who is a bloudy, ill man) runs and takes up his sword,
comes to the duke, and gives him his mortal wound, of which the
duke dyed before he could get home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is of some interest to compare the above with
Thackeray&rsquo;s account of the duel in <i>Esmond</i>, book
iii., chap. v.&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas but three days after the 15th November 1712
(Esmond minds him well of the date), that he went by invitation
to dine with his General (Webb).&rdquo;&nbsp; At the end of the
feast Swift rushes to say that Duke Hamilton had been killed in a
duel.&nbsp; &ldquo;They fought in Hyde Park just before
sunset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I read the story in <i>Esmond</i> I was naturally struck
by Thackeray&rsquo;s making the duel occur three days after 15th
November instead of on that day.&nbsp; I applied to my friend Dr
Henry Jackson, who pointed out that the apparent error arises
from the absence of a comma.&nbsp; The above passage should
run:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was about three days after, the 15th of November
1712 (Esmond minds him well of the date), that he went,
etc.&rdquo;&nbsp; This makes Thackeray&rsquo;s account agree with
Hearne&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Dr Jackson has pointed out to me that the
duel was fought at 7 A.M., not just before sunset as Swift is
made to declare.&nbsp; The evidence is in Swift&rsquo;s Journal
to Mrs Dingley, of which extract Charles John Smith gave a
facsimile in his <i>Historical and Literary Curiosities</i>,
1840:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>&ldquo;Before this comes to your
Hands, you will have heard of the most terrible Accident that
hath almost ever happened.&nbsp; This morning at 8, my men
brought me word that D. Hamilton had fought with Ld. Mohun and
killed him and was brought home wounded.&nbsp; I immediately sent
him to the Duke&rsquo;s house in St James&rsquo;s Square, but the
porter could hardly answer for tears and a great Rabble was about
the House.&nbsp; In short they fought at 7 this morning the Dog
Mohun was killed on the spot, and wile (<i>sic</i>) the Duke was
over him Mohun shortening his sword stabbed him in at the
shoulder to the heart the Duke was helpt towards the lake house
by the Ring in the park (where they fought), <a

class="citation">[39]</a> and dyed in the Grass before he could
reach the House and was brought home in his Coach by 8, while the
poor Dutchess was asleep. . . .&nbsp; I am told that a footman of
Ld. Mohun&rsquo;s stabbd D. Hamilton; and some say Mackartney did
so too.&nbsp; Mohun gave the affront and yet sent the
Challenge.&nbsp; I am infinitly concerned for the poor Duke who
was a frank honest good natured man, I loved him very well and I
think he loved me better.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I insert the following extract as it records what was of great
importance to Hearne personally, since he refused to recognise
George I. as the legitimate monarch.</p>
<p>3<i>rd Aug.</i> 1714.&mdash;&ldquo;On Sunday morning (Aug.
1st) <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>died queen Anne, about 7 o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; She had
been taken ill on Friday immediately before.&nbsp; Her distemper
an apoplexy, or, as some say, only convulsions.&nbsp; She was
somewhat recovered, and then made Shrewsbury lord
treasurer.&nbsp; On Sunday last, in the afternoon, George Lewis,
elector of Brunswick, was proclaimed in London King of Great
Britain, France, and Ireland, by virtue of an act of parliament,
by which those that are much nearer to the crown by bloud are
excluded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following extract illustrates the feeling in Oxford under
the first Hanoverian sovereign.&nbsp; Very few, however, showed
Hearne&rsquo;s consistent and courageous Jacobinism:&mdash;</p>
<p>29<i>th May</i> 1715.&mdash;&ldquo;Last night a good part of
the presbyterian meeting-house in Oxford was pulled down.&nbsp;
There was such a concourse of people going up and down, and
putting a stop to the least sign of rejoycing, as cannot be
described.&nbsp; But then the rejoycing this day (notwithstanding
Sunday) was so very great and publick in Oxford, as hath not been
known hardly since the restauration.&nbsp; There was not an house
next the street but was illuminated.&nbsp; For if any disrespect
was shown, the windows were certainly broke.&nbsp; The people run
up and down, crying <i>King James the third</i>!&nbsp; <i>The
true King</i>!&nbsp; <i>No usurper</i>!&nbsp; <i>The duke of
Ormond</i>! and healths were everywhere drank suitable to the
occasion, and every one at the same time drank to a new
restauration, which I heartily wish may speedily
happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I give the following extract as a record of the dinner hour in
Oxford in 1717:&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>24<i>th April</i> 1717.&mdash;&ldquo;On Sunday morning
last (being Easter-day) Dr Charlett, master of University
college, sent his man to invite me to dinner that day.&nbsp; I
sent him word that I was engaged, as indeed I was.&nbsp;
Yesterday he sent again.&nbsp; I sent word I would wait upon
him.&nbsp; Accordingly I went at twelve o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; When
I came I found nobody with him but Mr Collins, of Magdalen coll.,
whom he had also invited.&rdquo; <a name="citation41"></a><a
href="#footnote41" class="citation">[41]</a></p>
<p>Here is an interesting scrap of history:&mdash;</p>
<p>19<i>th April</i> 1718.&mdash;&ldquo;. . .&nbsp; King William
the Conqueror&rsquo;s beard alwayes shaven, for so was the
custome of the Norman.&nbsp; Thus were the Englishmen forced to
imitate the Normans in habit of apparell, shaving off their
beards, service at the table, and in all other outward
gestures.&nbsp; The English before did not use to shave their
upper lips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>11<i>th Nov.</i> 1720.&mdash;&ldquo;Dr Wynne. . . .&nbsp; This
worthy doctor was the man also that put a stop to the selling of
fellowships in All Soul&rsquo;s college, as I have often heard
him say; and I have as often heard him likewise say, that he
always voted for the poorest candidaters for fellowships in that
college, provided they were equally qualified in other respects;
a thing not practised now.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>Here is a pleasant inversion of the relation between boy
and schoolmaster:&mdash;</p>
<p>21<i>st Jan.</i> 1718&ndash;19.&mdash;&ldquo;I remember that I
heard formerly Tom Rogers, who was yeoman beadle, say, that when
he was that year, when the plague raged, a school-boy at Eaton,
all the boys of that school were obliged to smoak in the school
every morning, and that he was never whipped so much in his life
as he was one morning for not smoaking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>27<i>th Feb.</i> 1722&ndash;23.&mdash;&ldquo;It hath been an
old custom in Oxford for the scholars of all houses, on Shrove
Tuesday, to go to dinner at ten o&rsquo;clock (at which time the
little bell, called <i>pan-cake bell</i>, rings, or at least
should ring, at St Maries), and at four in the afternoon; and it
was always followed in Edmund hall, as long as I have been in
Oxford, till yesterday, when they went to dinner at twelve, and
to supper at six, nor were there any fritters at dinner, as there
used always to be.&nbsp; When laudable old customs alter,
&rsquo;tis a sign learning dwindles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hope that modern Oxford has returned to pancakes on Shrove
Tuesday.</p>
<p>There is a pleasant touch of medi&aelig;valness in the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>10<i>th July</i> 1723.&mdash;&ldquo;There are two fairs a year
at Wantage, in Berks, the first on 7th July, being the
translation of St Thomas &agrave; Becket, and the second on the
6th of October, being St Faith&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; But this year,
the 7th of July being a Sunday, the fair was kept last Monday,
and &rsquo;twas a very great one; and yesterday it was held too,
when there was a very great match of backsword or cudgell playing
<!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>between the hill-country and the vale-country, Berkshire
men being famous for this sport or excercise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following account makes one inclined to sympathise with
Hearne&rsquo;s avoidance of travelling:&mdash;</p>
<p>21<i>st Sept.</i> 1723.&mdash;&ldquo;They wrote from Dover,
Sept. 14, that the day before, col. Churchill, with two other
gentlemen, arrived there from Calais, by whom they received the
following account, viz., that on Thursday morning last, Mr
Seebright and Mr Davis being in one chair, and Mr Mompesson and a
servant in another chaise, with one servant on horseback,
pursuing their way to Paris, were, about seven miles from Calais,
attacked by six ruffians, who demanded the three hundred guineas
which they said were in their pockets and portmanteaus.&nbsp; The
gentlemen readily submitted, and surrendered the money; yet the
villains, after a little consultation, resolved to murder them,
and thereupon shot Mr Seebright thro&rsquo; the heart, and gave
the word for killing the rest: then Mr Davis, who was in the
chaise with him, shot at one of them, missed the fellow, but
killed his horse; upon which he was immediately killed, being
shot and stabb&rsquo;d in several places.&nbsp; Mr Mompesson and
the two servants were likewise soon dispatched in a very
barbarous manner.&nbsp; During this bloudy scene, Mr John Locke
coming down a hill within sight of them, in his return from
Paris, the ruffians sent two of their party to meet and kill him;
which they did before the poor gentleman was apprized of any
danger; but his man, who was a Swiss, begging hard for his life,
was <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>spared.&nbsp; This happening near a small village where
they had taken their second post, a peasant came by in the
interim, and was also murdered.&nbsp; They partly flead, and
otherwise mangled, the horse that was killed, to prevent its
being known; so that &rsquo;tis believed they did not live far
from Calais.&nbsp; The unfortunate gentlemen afore mentioned, not
being used to travel, had unwarily discovered at Calais what sums
they had about them, by exchanging their guineas for Louis
d&rsquo;ors, which is supposed to have given occasion to this
dismal tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>27<i>th July</i> 1726.&mdash;&ldquo;This is the day kept in
honour of the Seven Sleepers, so called, because in the reign of
Theodosius the second, about the year 449, when the resurrection
(as we have it from Greg. Turon.) came to be doubted by many,
seven persons, who had been buried alive in a cave at Ephesus by
Decius the emperor, in the time of his persecution against the
Christians, and had slept for about 200 years, awoke and
testified the truth of this doctrine, to the great amazement of
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the following passage Hearne shows (as in some other
instances) a certain antagonism to Sir Isaac Newton.&nbsp; I
hope, however, that he was impressed by what he quotes from the
<i>Reading Post</i>, viz. that &ldquo;six noble peers supported
the pall&rdquo; at the funeral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Isaac Newton had promised to be a benefactor to the
Royal society, but failed.&nbsp; Some time before he died, a
great quarrel happened between him and Dr Halley, so as they fell
to bad language.&nbsp; This, &rsquo;tis thought, so much
discomposed Sir Isaac as to hasten his end.&nbsp; Sir Isaac died
in great pain, <!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>though he was not sick, which pain
proceeded from some inward decay, as appeared from opening
him.&nbsp; He is buried in Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; Sir Isaac was
a man of no promising aspect.&nbsp; He was a short well-set
man.&nbsp; He was full of thought, and spoke very little in
company, so that his conversation was not agreeable.&nbsp; When
he rode in his coach, one arm would be out of the coach on one
side, and the other on the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>25<i>th April</i> 1727.&mdash;&ldquo;Mr West tells me, in a
letter from London of the 22nd inst., that being lately in
Cambridgeshire, he spent two days in that university, both which
times he had the pleasure of seeing my friend Mr Baker, who was
pleased to walk with him, and shew him his college, the library,
etc.&nbsp; What hath been given to the library by Mr Baker
himself, is no small addition to it; Mr Baker being turned out of
his fellowship for his honesty and integrity (as I have also lost
my places for the same reason, in not taking the wicked oaths),
writes himself in all his books <i>socius ejectus</i>.&nbsp; His
goodness and humanity are as charming, to those who have the
happiness of his conversation, as his learning is profitable to
his correspondents.&nbsp; The university library is not yet put
into any order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>25<i>th June</i> 1728.&mdash;&ldquo;The Cambridge men are much
wanting to themselves, in not retrieving the remains of their
worthies.&nbsp; Mr Baker is the only man I know of there, that
hath of late acted in all respects worthily on that head, and for
it he deserves a statue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3<i>rd Aug.</i> 1728.&mdash;&ldquo;Yesterday Mr Gilman of St
<!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>Peter&rsquo;s parish in the east, Oxford (a lusty,
heartick, <a name="citation46a"></a><a href="#footnote46a"
class="citation">[46a]</a> thick, and short man), told me, that
he is in his 85th year of age, and that at the restoration of K.
Charles II., being much afflicted with the king&rsquo;s evil, he
rode up to London behind his father, was touched on a Wednesday
morning by the king, was in very good condition by that night,
and by the Sunday night immediately following was perfectly
recovered and hath so continued ever since.&nbsp; He hath
constantly wore the piece of gold about his neck that he received
of the king, and he had it on yesterday when I met
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hope that Oxford, which had treated poor Hearne so ill, was
impressed by the facts recorded on 10th June 1730:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Thursday, June 4th, the earl of Oxford (Edw. Harley)
was at my room at Edm. hall from ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning
till a little after twelve o&rsquo;clock, together with Dr
Conyers Middleton, of Trin. coll. Camb., and my lord&rsquo;s
nephew, the hon. Mr May of Christ Church, and Mr Murray of Christ
Church.&rdquo;</p>

Benedict Leonard Calvert <a name="citation46b"></a><a

1732 (old stile) of a consumption, in the <i>Charles</i>, Capt.
Watts commander, and was buried in the sea.&nbsp; When he left
England he seemed to think that he was becoming an exile, and
that he should never see his native country more; and yet neither
myself nor any else could disswade him from going.&nbsp; He was
as <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>well beloved as an angel could be in his station; (he
being governour of Maryland); for our plantations have a natural
aversion to their governours, upon account of their too usual
exactions, pillages, and plunderings; but Mr Calvert was free
from all such, and therefore there was no need of constraint on
that score: but then it was argument enough to be harrassed that
he was their governour, and not only such, but brother to Ld.
Baltimore, the lord proprietor of Maryland, a thing which himself
declared to his friends, who were likewise too sensible of
it.&nbsp; And the same may appear also from a speech or two of
his on occasion of some distraction, which tho&rsquo; in print I
never yet saw.&nbsp; I had a sincere respect for him, and he and
I used to spend much time together in searching after
curiosities, etc., so that he hath often said that &rsquo;twas
the most pleasant part of his life, as other young gentlemen,
likewise then in Oxford have also as often said, that the many
agreeable hours we used to spend together on the same occasion
were the most entertaining and most pleasant part of their
lives.&nbsp; As Mr Calvert and the rest of those young gentlemen
(several of which, as well as Mr Calvert, were of noble birth)
used to walk and divert themselves with me in the country, much
notice was taken thereof, and many envyed our
happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>5<i>th July</i> 1733.&mdash;&ldquo;One Handel, a foreigner
(who, they say, was born at Hanover), being desired to come to
Oxford, to perform in musick this Act, in which he hath great
skill, is come down, the <!-- page 48--><a

do, and, as an encouragement, to allow him the benefit of the
Theater, both before the Act begins and after it.&nbsp;
Accordingly he hath published papers for a performance to-day, at
5s. a ticket.&nbsp; This performance began a little after five
o&rsquo;clock in the evening.&nbsp; This is an inovation.&nbsp;
The players might be as well permitted to come and act.&nbsp; The
Vice-Chancellor is much blamed for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>16<i>th Sept.</i> 1733.&mdash;&ldquo;Mr Sacheverel, who died a
few years since, of Denman&rsquo;s Farm (in Berks) near Oxford,
was looked upon as the best judge of bells in England.&nbsp; He
used to say, that Horsepath bells near Oxford, tho&rsquo; but
five in number, and very small, were the prettiest, tunablest
bells in England, and that there was not a fault in one, except
the 3d, and that so small a fault, as it was not to be discerned
but by a very good judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3<i>rd Oct.</i> 1733.&mdash;&ldquo;I hear of iron bedsteads in
London.&nbsp; Dr Massey told me of them on Saturday, 29th Sept.

have, since the great fire, been very troublesome in
London.&rdquo;</p>

is my great friend, though I am unknown in person to him) tells
me in his letter of the 16th of last December, that he hath
always thought it a happiness to dye in time, and says of
himself, that he is really affraid of living too long.&nbsp; He
is above seventy, as he told me some time since.&rdquo;</p>

he will lend me any book he hath, and wonders I will not go to
London and see my friends; and see what MSS. and papers are
there, and in other libraries, that are worth printing.&nbsp; I
could give several reasons for my not going either to London or
other places, which however I did not trouble his lordship
with.&nbsp; Among others, &rsquo;tis probable I might receive a
much better welcome than I deserve, or is suitable to one that so
much desires and seeks a private humble life, without the least
pomp or grandeur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2<i>nd May</i> 1734.&mdash;&ldquo;Yesterday an attempt was
made upon New college bells of 6876 changes.&nbsp; They began a
quarter before ten in the morning, and rang very well until four
minutes after twelve, when Mr Brickland, a schoolmaster of St
Michael&rsquo;s parish, who rang the fifth bell, missed a stroke,
it put a stop to the whole, so that they presently set them, and
so sunk the peal, which is pity, for &rsquo;twas really very true
ringing, excepting five faults, which I observ&rsquo;d (for I
heard all the time, tho&rsquo; &rsquo;twas very wet all the
while) in that part of the Parks which is on the east side of
Wadham college, where I was very private; one of which five
faults was the treble, that was rung by Mr Richard Hearne, and
the other four were faults committed by the aforesaid Mr
Brickland, who &rsquo;twas feared by several beforehand would not
fully perform his part. . . .&rdquo;</p>

himself.&nbsp; Upon which I asked him how many there were?&nbsp;
He said three before that which stopp&rsquo;d them.&nbsp; I told
him that there just five before that, at which he admired my
niceness.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To entertain the lag-end of my life<br />
With quiet hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&mdash;<i>Henry IV.</i>, Pt. I.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was born at Down on 16th August 1848: I was christened at
Malvern&mdash;a fact in which I had a certain unaccountable
pride.&nbsp; But now my only sensation is one of surprise at
having been christened at all, and a wish that I had received
some other name.&nbsp; I was never called Francis, and I disliked
the usual abbreviation Frank, while Franky or Frankie seemed to
me intolerable.&nbsp; I also considered it a hardship to have but
one Christian name.&nbsp; Our parents began by giving two names
to the elder children; but their inventive capacity gave way and
the younger ones had each but one.&nbsp; It seemed, too, a
singular fact that&mdash;as they afterwards confessed&mdash;they
gave names which they did not especially like.&nbsp; Our
godfathers and godmothers were usually uncles and aunts, but this
tepid relationship was deprived of any conceivable interest by
the fact that the uncles were usually represented by the parish
clerk.&nbsp; This, of course, we only knew by rumour, but we
realised that they gave no christening mugs&mdash;a line of
conduct in which I now fully sympathise.&nbsp; My <!-- page
52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>brother Leonard did indeed receive a silver spoon from
Mr Leonard Horner, but I fancy that this came to him on false
pretences.</p>
<p>I have no idea at what age we began to go to church, but I
have a general impression of unwillingly attending divine service
for many boyish years.&nbsp; We had a large pew, lined with green
baize, close beneath the clergyman&rsquo;s desk, and so near the
clerk that we got the full flavour of his tremendous amens.&nbsp;
I have a recollection of entertaining myself with the
india-rubber threads out of my elastic-sided boots, and of gently
tweaking them when stretched as miniature harp-strings.&nbsp; The
only other diverting circumstance was the occurrence of book-fish
(Lepisma?) in the prayer books or among the baize cushions.&nbsp;
I have not seen one for fifty years, and I may be wrong in
believing that they were like minute sardines running on
invisible wheels.&nbsp; In looking back on the service in Down
church, I am astonished at the undoubted fact that whereas the
congregation in general turned towards the altar in saying the
Creed, we faced the other way and sternly looked into the eyes of
the other churchgoers.&nbsp; We certainly were not brought up in
Low Church or anti-papistical views, and it remains a mystery why
we continued to do anything so unnecessary and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I have a general impression of coming out of church cold and
hungry, and of seeing the labourers standing about the porch in
tall hats and green or purple smock-frocks.&nbsp; But the chief
object of interest was Sir John Lubbock (the father of the late
Lord <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>Avebury), of whom, for no particular reason, we stood in
awe.&nbsp; He made it up to us by coming to church in a splendid
fluffy beaver hat.&nbsp; My recollection is that we often went
only to the afternoon service, which we preferred for its
brevity.&nbsp; I have a clear recollection of our delight when,
on rainy Sundays, we escaped church altogether.</p>
<p>A feature that distinguished Sunday from the rest of the week
was our singular custom of having family prayers on that day
only.&nbsp; When we were growing up we mildly struck at the
ceremony, and my mother accordingly dropped it on finding that
the servants took no especial interest in it.</p>
<p>On Sundays we wore our best jackets, but I think that, when
church was over, we put on our usual tunics or blouses of
surprising home-made fit.&nbsp; But I clearly remember climbing
(in my Sunday clothes) a holly-tree on a damp Christmas Day, and
meeting my father as I descended green from head to foot.&nbsp; I
remember the occurrence because my father was justly annoyed, and
this impressed the fact on me, since anything approaching anger
was with him almost unknown.</p>
<p>In our blouses we might with impunity cover ourselves with the
thick red clay of our country-side, and this we could always do
by playing in a certain pit where we built clay forts, etc.&nbsp;
We used also to run down the steep ploughed fields, our feet
(grown with adhering clay to huge balls) swinging like pendulums
and scattering showers of mud on all sides.&nbsp; Then we would
come cheerfully home, entering by the back door and taking off
our boots <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>as we sat on the kitchen stairs in
semi-darkness and surrounded by pleasant culinary smells.</p>
<p>In later years, when we used to take long winter tramps along
our flinty winding lanes, this unbooting on the back stairs was a
prelude to eating oranges in the dining-room, a feast that took
the place of five o&rsquo;clock tea&mdash;not then invented.</p>
<p>In the early days of which I was speaking, we had schoolroom
tea with our governess, while our parents dined in peace at about
6.30.&nbsp; We came down after our tea, rushing along the dark
passage and descending the stairs with that rhythmic series of
bangs peculiar to children.&nbsp; I do not know that we were
really frightened at passing certain dark doorways, but I
certainly remember enjoying a sort of sham terror.&nbsp; One of
these doors led into my mother&rsquo;s room and also to a
store-room; I cannot think that this had any &ldquo;night
fears&rdquo; for us, because it smelt so strongly of such
everyday earthly things as soap and tallow candles.&nbsp; Why it
was placed next to the bedroom I do not know.&nbsp; I have no
clear remembrance of what we did in the evenings, but I seem to
see a round table and a moderator lamp, such as occurs in John
Leech&rsquo;s pictures in <i>Punch</i>.&nbsp; I have also a faint
recollection of black-coated uncles sitting by the fire and not
unnaturally objecting to our making short-cuts across their
legs.&nbsp; It was no doubt a pity that we were not reproved for
our want of consideration for the elderly, and that, generally
speaking, our manners were neglected.&nbsp; One of our grown-up
cousins was reported to have called our midday dinner &ldquo;a
violent luncheon,&rdquo; and I do not <!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>doubt that
she was right.&nbsp; We were fortunate in having a set of simple,
kindly, old-fashioned servants with whom we could be on friendly
terms.&nbsp; Thus it happens that recollections cluster about the
kitchen and pantry.&nbsp; I have a vague remembrance of a Welsh
cook, Mrs Davis, who was very kind to us in spite of constant
threats of &ldquo;tying a dish-cloth to your tail,&rdquo; which,
so far as I know, remained a threat, and was indeed never
understood by me.&nbsp; We certainly could generally extract
gingerbread and other good things from Daydy, as we called Mrs
Davis.&nbsp; The butler, Parslow, was a kind friend to us all our
lives.&nbsp; I do not remember being checked by him except in
being turned out of the dining-room when he wanted to lay the
table for luncheon, or being stopped in some game which
threatened the polish of the sideboard, of which he spoke as
though it were his private property.&nbsp; He had what may be
called a baronial nature: he idealised everything about our
modest household, and would draw a glass of beer for the postman
with the air of a seneschal bestowing a cup of malvoisie on a
troubadour.&nbsp; He would not, I think, have disgraced Charles
Lamb&rsquo;s friend Captain Burney, who welcomed his guests in
the grand manner to the simplest of feasts.&nbsp; It was good to
see him on Christmas Day: with how great an air would he enter
the breakfast-room and address us:&mdash;&ldquo;Ladies and
Gentlemen, I wish you a happy Christmas, etc. etc.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
am afraid he got but a sheepish response from us.&nbsp; Among the
outdoor servants there were three whom I remember well.&nbsp;
There was Brooks, <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>the general outdoor man, who acted as
gardener, cowman, etc.&nbsp; He had dark eyes and a melancholy,
morose face.&nbsp; Of him I have told elsewhere <a
name="citation56a"></a><a href="#footnote56a"
class="citation">[56a]</a> the following anecdote:&mdash;</p>
<p>Brooks had been accused by the other gardener of using foul
language, and was hailed before my father to be judged.&nbsp; I,
as a little boy, standing in the hall, heard my father say,
&ldquo;You know you are a very bad-tempered man.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, sir&rdquo; (in a tone of deep depression).&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then get out of the room&mdash;you ought to be ashamed of
yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this point I rushed upstairs in vague
alarm and heard no more.</p>
<p>Brooks lived in a cottage close to the cow-yard, with his
wife, in whom I took an interest because her name was Keziah, and
because she was the best smocker in the village.&nbsp; I have a
vague recollection of a private in the Guards to whom I was
introduced as a son of Brooks&mdash;a statement I regarded as
surprising.&nbsp; Mrs Brooks was as melancholy as her husband,
and I remember many years later, when the pair were pensioned off
in the village, hearing Brooks say in her presence, &ldquo;She
ain&rsquo;t no comfort to me, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; To this she made
no retort, though a <i>tu quoque</i> would have been most
just.</p>
<p>The under-gardener, Lettington (the man who objected to being
sworn at), was a kindly person and a great friend of mine.&nbsp;
It was he who taught me to make whistles <a
name="citation56b"></a><a href="#footnote56b"
class="citation">[56b]</a> in the spring and helped me with my
tame rabbits.&nbsp; He also showed me how to make brick-traps for
small birds, and a more elaborate trap <!-- page 57--><a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>made of hazel
twigs.&nbsp; In this last I remember catching a blackbird: I
imagine that I must have been rather afraid of my captive, for
the unfortunate bird escaped leaving its tail in my hands.&nbsp;
I do not think I ever wanted to kill the few other birds caught
in traps, but let them go free.&nbsp; I clearly remember looking
with envy and admiration at Bewicke&rsquo;s woodcuts of traps,
<i>e.g.</i> that of the woodcock springe, and another of a sieve
propped up over grain sprinkled as bait.</p>
<p>To return to Lettington.&nbsp; It was he who helped my father
in his experiments on the crossing of plants: he lived to a great
age, dying as a pensioner many years later.&nbsp; My father used
to tell with amusement how Lettington never failed to remind him
of a bad prophecy:&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, sir, but you said so-and-so
would happen.&rdquo;&nbsp; The third outdoor man was Thomas
Price, generally known as the Dormouse on account of his
somnolent manner of working.&nbsp; We, as boys, believed him to
be a deserter from the army on account of the military set of his
shoulders, and because he had arrived in the village an unknown
wanderer.&nbsp; He was a bachelor and spent more than was wise on
beer.&nbsp; For the last few years of his life my mother made him
save money by the simple process of retaining part of his wages
in her own hands.&nbsp; In this way he unwillingly acquired some
&pound;20 or &pound;30, but as he refused to leave it to those
who took care of him in his last illness, it went to the Crown,
to whom I hope it made up for the loss of T. Price&rsquo;s very
doubtful military services.</p>
<p><!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>In later years it occurred to us that the methods of
gardening at Down were antiquated, and we persuaded our parents
to engage an active young Scotchman whom I will call X, and who
was placed in command of Lettington and the Dormouse (the gloomy
Brooks having been pensioned).&nbsp; The two old servants were
dreadfully bustled by X, and I well remember their flushed faces
after the first morning&rsquo;s digging in the serious Scotch
manner.&nbsp; After a time, finding that matters were very little
looked after, X began some mysterious dealings in cows with a
neighbouring farmer, and it was suddenly discovered that a cow
had disappeared.&nbsp; I remember my shame at finding I did not
know how many cows we ought to have, nor could I swear to their
personal appearance.&nbsp; But by dint of cross-examination I was
enabled to draw up a statement of how cow A had been sold, cow B
bought, and cow C exchanged for cow D, etc.&nbsp; Finally the
ingenious X was discharged, and the rejoicing Lettington and
Dormouse reinstated.&nbsp; But before this fortunate conclusion,
I had at my father&rsquo;s bidding taken steps to obtain a
summons against X.&nbsp; I remember thinking what a fool I should
look when cross-examined before the magistrates.&nbsp; Another
circumstance is impressed on my mind.&nbsp; The affair occurred
in that remarkable October in which the trees were greatly
injured by a snowstorm, and as I drove in a dog-cart through
Holwood Park in search of the summons, I thought, as the trees
cracked like pistols, that it was hardly worth while being
crushed to death for the sake <!-- page 59--><a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>of any number
of cows.&nbsp; Finally X was not prosecuted, and departed in
peace.</p>
<p>To return to my childhood: I came between George and Leonard,
and was a companion to both of them, but I do not think we made a
trio as Leonard and Horace and I did more or less.&nbsp; I have a
clear recollection of Leonard in a red fez, and bare legs covered
with scratches, but I cannot distinctly call up images of the
others.&nbsp; I seem to remember a great deal of purposeless
wandering with my younger brothers; but with George, playing was
an organised affair in which I was an obedient subordinate, as I
have described in <i>Rustic Sounds</i>.&nbsp; Our chief game was
playing at soldiers; we had toy guns to which home-made wooden
bayonets were fixed, knapsacks, and I think shakos&mdash;whether
we had any uniform coats I cannot remember.&nbsp; In the
cloakroom under the stairs our names and heights were recorded,
and George conscientiously constructed a short foot-rule so that
our height should come to something like six feet.&nbsp; I had to
keep sentry at the far end of the kitchen garden until released
by a bugle-call.&nbsp; George being a sergeant was exempt from
sentry work, and was merely responsible for the
bugle-blowing.&nbsp; Indoors there was much playing with tin
soldiers.&nbsp; I remember a regiment of dragoons whose coats my
mother had laboriously reddened with sealing-wax to convert them
into British soldiers.&nbsp; The troopers were in a ferocious
charging attitude with swords raised, but the blades were mostly
broken, and I innocently believed that they were all raising
crusts of bread <!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>to their mouths.&nbsp; Another
indoors game was the hurling of darts at one another in the long
passage upstairs; we had wooden shields on which the javelins
used to strike briskly enough, since they were weighted with
lead.&nbsp; On these occasions we were knights or men-at-arms,
but out of doors we were savages.&nbsp; George could hurl
hazel-spears, using the Australian throwing-stick, an art I never
acquired, but I was fond of slinging stones.&nbsp; To make a
sling a bit of leather was necessary, and this meant a visit to
the village cobbler, Parker by name, who was a short, sallow man
with the bristling chin which, according to Dickens, <a
name="citation60"></a><a href="#footnote60"
class="citation">[60]</a> is the universal attribute of
cobblers.&nbsp; I remember the pleasure of sending, with my
sling, a pebble crashing into the big ash-tree in the field from
what seemed to me a great distance.</p>
<p>Another pursuit was walking on stilts, of which we had two
kinds; on the smaller ones even girls had been known to walk, but
of the larger (which I remember as of imposing height) only the
male sex was capable.&nbsp; The garden at Down was originally a
bare and windy wilderness, but our parents constructed mounds of
raw red clay on which laurel and box finally grew and made
shelter.&nbsp; One of these mounds, covered with dwarf box-trees,
was known to us as the Pyrenees, and our pleasure was to traverse
the passes on stilts.&nbsp; There was a slight sense of danger
and a certain romance in climbing the heights from the lawn and
descending in what was legally a part of the orchard, where <!--
page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>the last of the limes grew and a particular crab-tree of
which I was fond.</p>
<p>Then there were two swings, one of the orthodox kind between
those twin yew-trees that gave a special character to the lawn,
and one consisting of a long rope fixed high up on the tall
Scotch fir that grew on the mound.&nbsp; The rope of the latter
had a short cross-bar at its lower end which served as a seat or
a handle.&nbsp; There were various tricks, some of which were
almost sure to bump the head of a strange child against the tree
trunk, to our private satisfaction.</p>
<p>A similar rope hanging from the ceiling of the long passage at
the top of the house supplied a more complicated set of tricks,
which all had special names.&nbsp; Of these, I remember that
<i>spangle</i> meant a method of sitting on one side of the
cross-bar at the end of the rope.&nbsp; The stairs leading to the
second floor jutted out into the passage; we used to stand with
one foot on each banister-supporting post and make it a
starting-point for a swing on the rope, also a landing-place, and
if we succeeded in getting back into position with a foot on each
banister-post we were pleased with ourselves, especially if it
was done at night without a light.&nbsp; The rope, working on the
hooks fixed into the ceiling, made a grinding or squeaking noise
which must have been annoying to guests, especially when mixed
with much crashing and banging and shouting.</p>
<p>In later years we played stump cricket and lawn tennis, but in
the early days of which I am thinking the only game I clearly
remember was the practice <!-- page 62--><a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>of the
village cricketers in our field.&nbsp; It seems improbable, yet I
am decidedly of opinion that the pitch was the footpath, the
unmown condition of the grass making bowling elsewhere an
impossibility; on the other hand it made fielding an easy
affair.&nbsp; I remember clearly the runs being recorded by
notches cut on a stick, a method of scoring which has its place
in literature in the match between All Muggleton and Dingley
Dell. <a name="citation62"></a><a href="#footnote62"
class="citation">[62]</a></p>
<p>It is curious to remember how solitary our life was.&nbsp; We
had literally no boy-friends in the whole neighbourhood; there
were plenty of boys within reach but we never amalgamated with
them, and were, I imagine, despised by them as outside the pale
of Eton-dom.&nbsp; No opportunity was made for us to learn to
shoot; I used to wander with a gun and shoot an occasional hare
and various blackbirds, but I never had even the meanest skill,
and after suffering miseries of shame at one or two
shooting-parties I am glad to think I gave it up.</p>
<p>Fishing there was none in our dry country, and it was only
very much later, on the beautiful Dovey in North Wales, that I
learned something of the art.</p>
<p>Riding we did learn in a casual, haphazard way, and some of us
hunted a little with a mild pack (the Old Surrey) in our bad
hunting country&mdash;but all this was much later and hardly
concerns my present subject.</p>
<p>The best practice I had as a boy was riding <!-- page 63--><a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>twice or
thrice a week (from perhaps my tenth to my twelfth year) to Mr
Reed, Rector of Hayes, to be taught Latin and a little
arithmetic.&nbsp; Our ponies were shaggy, obstinate little
beasts, who had the strongest possible dislike of their
duties.&nbsp; I remember well how my pony turned round and round,
and at last consented to proceed till a new excuse occurred for a
bolt towards home.&nbsp; It was a secret delight to me when one
of my brothers was beaten in the pony-fight and was brought
ignominiously home.</p>
<p>Mr Reed was the kindest of teachers, and after a short spell
of Latin he used to give me a slice of cake and allow me to look
at the wonderful pictures in an old Dutch Bible.&nbsp; Even under
the mild discipline of this kindest of men I used to dissolve in
tears over my work.</p>
<p>When I was twelve years old, <i>i.e.</i> in the summer of
1860, I went to the Grammar School at Clapham kept by Rev.
Charles Pritchard.&nbsp; I was two years under Pritchard, and
when he left <a name="citation63"></a><a href="#footnote63"
class="citation">[63]</a> I remained under his successor, Rev.
Alfred Wrigley, until I went up to Trinity College, Cambridge,
1866.&nbsp; Wrigley had none of the force of Pritchard, nor had
he, I fancy, his predecessor&rsquo;s gift of teaching.&nbsp;
Mathematics formed a great part of our curriculum, and for these
I had no turn.&nbsp; I am, however, grateful to Wrigley for
having made me work out a great many logarithmic calculations
which had to be shown up (as he expressed it) in a &ldquo;neat,
tabular <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>form.&rdquo;&nbsp; As I have said in
my article on my brother George in <i>Rustic Sounds</i>, my
&ldquo;recollections of George at Clapham are coloured by an
abiding gratitude for his kindly protection of me as a shrinking
and very unhappy &lsquo;new boy&rsquo; in 1860.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From school I went to Trinity College, Cambridge.&nbsp; I
lodged first with a tailor called Daniells in Bridge Street,
nearly opposite to the new chapel of St John&rsquo;s&mdash;the
slow rise of which I used to watch from my windows.&nbsp;
Afterwards I moved into rooms on the ground floor to the left of
the New Court Gate that leads out into the Backs.&nbsp; Why the
architect made the sitting-rooms look into the Court and all its
mean stucco decorations I cannot imagine.&nbsp; My bedroom looked
out on the Backs and its avenue of lime-trees, where the
nightingales sang through the happy May nights.</p>
<p>I hardly made any permanent friends till my second year, when
I had the good fortune to become intimate with Edmund Gurney and
Charles Crawley, both of whom died early.&nbsp; Crawley was
drowned in a boating accident in which he tried in vain to save
the women of the party.&nbsp; Edward Stirling, an Australian, has
only recently (1919) died.&nbsp; I am glad to think that my
undergraduate friends (except those removed by death) are still
my friends.</p>
<p>Among the Dons who were friendly to students of natural
science the first place must be given to Alfred Newton, the
Professor of Zoology, who most kindly invited us to come to his
rooms in Magdalene any and every Sunday evening.&nbsp; There we
smoked our pipes and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly.&nbsp; We <!--
page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>had the advantage of meeting older members of the
University.&nbsp; It was in this way I became acquainted with G.
R. Crotch, of St John&rsquo;s, who was an assistant in the
University Library.&nbsp; He was a strikingly handsome man with a
long silky beard and wonderful eyes.&nbsp; His passion was
Entomology, and he had a great knowledge of the Coleoptera, and
used sometimes to take me out beetle-catching, but I never became
a collector.&nbsp; He was eccentric in his habits; for instance,
he dressed entirely in black flannel&mdash;shirt, coat, and
trousers&mdash;which were made for him by Brown, the tailor, who
was a brother entomologist.&nbsp; He finally gave up his
librarianship and went off beetle-catching to the United States,
where he died in what would have been miserable conditions but
for the tender care bestowed on him by a complete stranger, whose
name I have unfortunately forgotten.&nbsp; There, too, I
occasionally saw Clifford, the well-known mathematician, who died
early&mdash;also Kingsley on at least one occasion.&nbsp; I
remember him, too, at the New Museums (where I was dissecting
some beast or other) reproving me for my white shirt, and telling
me that flannel was far more suitable for dissections.&nbsp; John
Willis Clark (who afterwards became Registrary of the University)
was then Curator of the New Museums, and encouraged me to work in
his department, and I well remember my pride when my preparation
of a hedgehog&rsquo;s inside was added to the Museum.&nbsp; J. W.
Clark was the kindest of men, and I, like many another
undergraduate, used to dine with him and his mother at Scrope
<!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>House.&nbsp; There some of us were introduced for the
first time to good claret.&nbsp; I remember Mrs Clark (rather a
masterful old lady) saying, &ldquo;Drink your wine like a good
boy and don&rsquo;t talk nonsense,&rdquo; as though these
precepts contained the whole duty of undergraduate man.&nbsp; J.
W. Clark was the patron and director of the undergraduates&rsquo;
Amateur Dramatic Society (the A. D. C.), and occasionally took a
part himself.&nbsp; I have a clear recollection of hearing him
(attired in red tights) exclaim in his peculiar pronunciation, in
which the letters <i>l</i> and <i>r</i> were indistinguishable,
&ldquo;I am the srave of the ramp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had left to the last the man whose kindness towards me as an
undergraduate I valued most highly, and whose friendship it is
still my good fortune to possess&mdash;I mean Henry Jackson, now
Professor of Greek, but at that time a Trinity lecturer.&nbsp; I
have an image of him walking up and down his room in
Neville&rsquo;s Court with a pipe in his mouth (which burned more
fiercely than did the pipes of other men), and talking with a
humour and enthusiasm which were a perpetual delight.&nbsp; A
literary venture, <i>The Tatler in Cambridge</i>, originated
among undergraduates under the editorship of the present Canon
Mason.&nbsp; To this I contributed a paper <i>On the Melancholy
of Bachelors</i>, which was accepted, chiefly, I think, through
the kindness of E. Gurney.&nbsp; I shall never forget my delight
when, on the day of its publication, Henry Jackson came round to
my rooms to tell me that he liked it.</p>
<p>I must now return to my more serious <!-- page 67--><a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>employments.&nbsp; It was at the suggestion of E. C.
Stirling that I became a medical student and began to work for
the Natural Sciences Tripos.&nbsp; In order to get more time for
the last-named examination I kept my small stock of mathematics
simmering as it were, and managed (without giving much time to
the subject) to get a mathematical degree as fifth among the
Junior Optimes in 1870.&nbsp; I had the pleasure of being coached
for this examination by James Stuart&mdash;the only man, I
imagine, who ever made mathematics entertaining and even amusing
to an unmathematical pupil.</p>
<p>I then had a clear year in which I could devote myself to
Natural Science.&nbsp; I did not succeed in finding a coach who
was of any use to me.&nbsp; But in Comparative Anatomy I did a
fair amount of undirected work: in this way I dissected a good
many creatures such as slugs and snails and freshwater mussels,
dragonflies, etc.&nbsp; I have a dim recollection of catching the
mussels in the Cam with Gordon Wigan, the son of the celebrated
actor&mdash;and indeed that kindly personage joined us in one of
our boating expeditions.</p>
<p>On leaving Cambridge I went to St George&rsquo;s Hospital with
the intention of becoming a practising physician.&nbsp; But
happily for me the Fates willed otherwise.&nbsp; The late Dr
Cavafy of St George&rsquo;s Hospital urged me to learn something
of Histology, and sent me to Dr Klein, whose pupil I had the good
fortune to become at the Brown Institute.&nbsp; I have elsewhere
<a name="citation67"></a><a href="#footnote67"
class="citation">[67]</a> said something of my debt of gratitude
to <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>Dr Klein.&nbsp; Under his guidance I produced a paper
which served as a thesis for my M.B. degree.&nbsp; I had another
interesting experience during my time at St George&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
I used to go to the Zoological Society&rsquo;s dissecting-room,
where the late Dr Garrod (the Prosector) allowed me to
investigate some of the daily quota of dead animals.&nbsp; But it
was not of any real educational value, I fancy.&nbsp; Still it
may have helped the impetus of Klein&rsquo;s teaching to suggest
that medicine <a name="citation68a"></a><a href="#footnote68a"
class="citation">[68a]</a> should be given up and that I should
become the assistant to my father.</p>
<p>The old nursery at Down had been turned into a laboratory, and
when (on the death of my wife) I came to live in the house of my
parents, they converted the billiard-room into a sitting-room for
me.</p>
<p>During the following years I went to work under Sachs at
W&uuml;rzburg and afterwards under De Bary at Strassburg.&nbsp;
Sachs was most kind and helpful, and under his direction I
contributed a small paper to his <i>Arbeiten</i>.&nbsp; I made
some good friends at W&uuml;rzburg&mdash;Stahl, who is now
Professor of Botany at Jena; Kunkel, the Pharmacologist, who died
young; the Finlander Elfving, who is now Professor of Botany at
Helsingfors; and Goebel, now the well-known Professor of Botany
at Munich.&nbsp; He and I walked side by side to receive our
degrees at the 1909 meeting in Cambridge. <a
name="citation68b"></a><a href="#footnote68b"
class="citation">[68b]</a>&nbsp; I had the great <!-- page
69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>pleasure of seeing Elfving on the same occasion, and we
have never ceased to correspond, though at irregular
intervals.&nbsp; I had once the satisfaction of receiving Stahl
as my guest at Cambridge.&nbsp; He is still Professor of Botany
at Jena, and in spite of rather weak health has published a mass
of good work.</p>
<p>I am sorry to think that my relationship with Sachs came to an
unhappy ending.&nbsp; I published what seemed to me a harmless
paper, in which I criticised some of his researches.&nbsp; I
wrote to him on the subject but received no answer.&nbsp; Partly
on account of his silence and partly to pay a visit to a friend,
I travelled to W&uuml;rzburg.&nbsp; I found Sachs in the Botanic
Garden; he seemed to wish to avoid me, but I went up to him and
asked him why he was angry with me.&nbsp; He replied: &ldquo;The
reason is very simple; you know nothing of Botany and you dare to
criticise a man like me.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had no opportunity of
replying, for at that moment one of his co-professors addressed
him, asking if he could spare a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very
willingly, Herr Professor,&rdquo; said Sachs, and walked off
without a word to me.&nbsp; And that was the last I saw of the
great botanist.&nbsp; I was undoubtedly stupid, but I do not
think he showed to advantage in the affair.</p>
<p>I continued to work with my father at Down, and in spite of
the advantages I gained by seeing and sharing in the work of
German laboratories, I now regret that so many months were spent
away from him.</p>

71</span>OLD INSTRUMENTS OF MUSIC <a name="citation71"></a><a
href="#footnote71" class="citation">[71]</a></h2>
<p>Mr Galpin has written an admirable book on old musical
instruments.&nbsp; His knowledge, which is first hand, is the
harvest of many years&rsquo; research; and, like the best type of
learned authors, he has the power of sharing his knowledge with
the ignorant.</p>
<p>His book begins with a study of stringed instruments, which
occupies about half the book, the remainder being given up to the
wind band.</p>
<p>My own experience of instruments of music is confined to the
latter division.&nbsp; I remember as a small boy at school
struggling with an elementary flute: or was it a penny
whistle?&nbsp; I believe it was a flute, for I have a dim
recollection of pouring water into it before it would
sound.&nbsp; I tried to teach the instrument&mdash;whatever it
was&mdash;to a friend, and wrote down the fingerings by a series
of black and white dots, in the manner quoted from Thomas
Greeting&rsquo;s <i>Pleasant Companion</i>, 1675, by Mr Galpin
(p. 146).&nbsp; Then when I was about fifteen or sixteen years
old I began under that admirable teacher, the late R. S.
Rockstro, to work regularly at the flute.&nbsp; As a Cambridge
undergraduate I remember playing flute <!-- page 72--><a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>solos at the
University Musical Society&rsquo;s concerts.&nbsp; And I can
still recall the pleasant sound of the applause which on one
occasion called for a repetition of my performance.&nbsp; Since
those days I took up the bassoon under the guidance of another
admirable teacher, Mr E. F. James.&nbsp; But nowadays my chief
interest is the recorder, which is best known to the unmusical
world from the well-known passage in <i>Hamlet</i>.&nbsp; Of this
instrument I shall have something to say in the sequel.&nbsp; I
give these personal details to show how small a right I have to
do more than give an abstract of Mr Galpin&rsquo;s admirable
book.</p>
<p>The first instrument dealt with is the harp, the essential
feature of which is that each string gives but one sound. <a
name="citation72"></a><a href="#footnote72"
class="citation">[72]</a>&nbsp; It is not clear to me why the
psaltery and dulcimer are separated from the harp, since they
also have unstopped strings and therefore unalterable
notes.&nbsp; Whereas the interpolated chapter ii. is concerned
with instruments&mdash;the gittern and citole&mdash;whose tones
are alterable in pitch by &ldquo;stopping,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>,
altering the length of the vibrating part of the string.&nbsp; I
can only suppose that the author considers that the fact of the
gittern and citole being sounded by plucking the strings, brings
these instruments into alliance with the harp.&nbsp; I confess
that I should like to have seen Class I. (strings unalterable in
tone) including the harp, the rote, the psaltery, dulcimer (Plate
I.), the &aelig;olian-harp, and the piano.&nbsp; Then would come
a class of instruments some at least of whose strings <!-- page
73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>produce a variety of tones by stopping, <i>i.e.</i>,
shortening the vibrating region of the string, and this would
include gittern and citole, lute, etc.&nbsp; But doubtless the
author has good reason for his arrangement, and I have not
knowledge enough to be his critic.</p>

</a></p>
<p>At p. 4 (Galpin) is represented the simple Irish harp or lyre
which was known as the cruit or crot; it is essentially a harp,
although it seems, in its infancy at any rate, to have had but
five or six strings.&nbsp; The name cruit or crot afterwards
developed into rotte, and under this name is described a
remarkable instrument apparently dating from the fifth to the
eighth centuries, which is figured at p. 34 (Galpin).&nbsp; It
was found in the Black Forest in the grave of a warrior, together
with his sword and bow, and seems to have been clasped in his
arms, as though he had especially valued it.&nbsp; The true harp,
which in its simplest form (Galpin, p. 8) chiefly differs from
the rote in shape, <a name="citation73a"></a><a
href="#footnote73a" class="citation">[73a]</a> is characterised
by the picturesque triangular outline that is so familiar.&nbsp;
It was of Teutonic origin, and Mr Galpin tells an admirable story
of a Saxon who disguised himself as a Briton, by playing the rote
instead of the harp, which would have revealed his
nationality.&nbsp; In spite of its Saxon parentage the Irish
adopted the harp, and a beautiful instrument of the early
thirteenth century is preserved at Trinity College, Dublin
(Galpin, p. 12).&nbsp; The Irish for <i>harp</i> is
<i>Clairsech</i>, <a name="citation73b"></a><a
href="#footnote73b" class="citation">[73b]</a> a word <!-- page
74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>that
reminds me of an Irish friend who used to quote&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Old Tracy and old Darcy<br />
Playing all weathers on the Clarsy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr Galpin tells a pleasant story of St Ealdhelm, who was
Bishop of Sherborne in the year 705.&nbsp; When he was about to
preach he found the church empty; he therefore took his harp, and
&ldquo;standing on a bridge hard by, soon attracted a
considerable crowd by his playing.&nbsp; Then he delivered his
sermon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chapter ii, p. 20, is devoted to the gittern and citole.&nbsp;
In the first-named instrument we have the ancestor of the guitar,
which it resembled in its flat back, and in the curving inwards
of the vertical sides. <a name="citation74a"></a><a
href="#footnote74a" class="citation">[74a]</a>&nbsp; It has
generally been believed that the &ldquo;waist&rdquo; thus
produced was an adaptation to the use of the bow, but, as the
author points out, this form occurs long before the existence of
bowed instruments. <a name="citation74b"></a><a
href="#footnote74b" class="citation">[74b]</a>&nbsp; At p. 22
(Galpin) is given an early fourteenth century illustration of a
gittern-player, holding in his right hand the plectrum with which
he sounds the strings.&nbsp; The most curious point, however, is
the depth of the neck of the instrument, which is pierced by a
large hole to admit the left thumb; without this curious device
it would apparently be impossible to stop the strings.&nbsp; On
the same plate is given an illustration of the precious gittern
at Warwick Castle, believed to date from about 1330, <!-- page
75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>in
which the thumb-hole is more clearly shown.&nbsp; The guitar,
which may be considered a descendant of the gittern, is said to
have completely eclipsed its ancestor in the seventeenth
century.&nbsp; And at the present time it, together with the
mandoline and the banjo, are the only representatives of the type
in every-day use.</p>
<p>Mr Galpin places the citole in the same class as the
gittern.&nbsp; He says that this instrument has been much
misunderstood, and since I do not desire to add my quota to the
injustice under which this unfortunate instrument suffers, I
shall pass on to the mandore and lute.&nbsp; The essential
characteristic of these instruments is that their bodies, instead
of having the flat back of the guitar, are rounded.&nbsp; Though
the body is now built of strips of wood or ivory, its form is
&ldquo;reminiscent of the time when the body or resonator
consisted of a simple gourd or half-gourd covered with
skin.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this they resemble the instruments of
Oriental races, and the author traces the form of the rebec and
mandoline as well as that of the mandore and lute to Persian,
Arabic, and Moorish influence in the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>The European lute had at first only four strings, but in the
&ldquo;elaborate instruments of the seventeenth century there
were twenty-six or thirty strings to be carefully tuned and
regulated.&rdquo;&nbsp; No wonder that a lutenist should have
been said to spend three-quarters of his existence in tuning his
instrument.&nbsp; The mandore was a small form of lute, and is
chiefly of interest because in a yet smaller form it still <!--
page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>survives as the mandoline, which, however, usually has
both wire and covered strings, and is played with a
plectrum.&nbsp; To return to the lute, its most obvious
characteristic is that the head (in which are the pegs for tuning
the strings) is bent at right-angles to the general plane of the
instrument.&nbsp; It is not clear what is the meaning of this
curious crook in the instrument, but it is some comfort to the
ignorant since it enables us to recognise a lute when we see
one.&nbsp; Henry VIII. and his daughters Mary and Elizabeth are
said to have been good lutenists.&nbsp; The smaller gut strings,
called by the pleasant name of <i>minnikins</i>, were easily
broken, and a gift of lute-strings was considered a present fit
for a queen, and one which the great Elizabeth did not
disdain.</p>
<p>There was also an archlute, which in its largest
form&mdash;six feet in height&mdash;was known as the
chitarrone.&nbsp; It had not the rectangular bend in the neck of
the ordinary lute; it was also characterised by having four or
five free or unstopped strings.&nbsp; A fine reproduction of Lady
Mary Sidney and her archlute faces the title-page of the
book.</p>
<p>Mr Galpin (p. 46) quotes from Thomas Mace&rsquo;s
<i>Musick&rsquo;s Monument</i>, 1676, the proper method of
&ldquo;fretting&rdquo; a lute or similar instrument.&nbsp; The
frets, or horizontal strings or wires which make cross ridges on
the neck of lutes, viols, etc., I had ignorantly imagined to be
guides to the beginner as to where to stop the string; but it
appears (Galpin, p. 46) that they &ldquo;add to its tone and
resonance by keeping the string from touching the <!-- page
77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>finger-board too closely.&rdquo;&nbsp; The word
&ldquo;fret&rdquo; is said to be derived from the old French
<i>ferrett&eacute;</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, banded with iron. <a

<p>In Mace&rsquo;s <a name="citation77b"></a><a
href="#footnote77b" class="citation">[77b]</a> book above
referred to he discourses with a child-like enthusiasm on his
favourite instrument.&nbsp; He does not follow the elder
lutenists, whom he describes as &ldquo;extreme shie in revealing
the <i>Occult</i> and <i>Hidden Secrets</i> of the
Lute.&rdquo;&nbsp; He gives the following examples of
&ldquo;<i>False and Ignorant Out-cries against the
Lute</i>&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">(1) &ldquo;That it is the <i>Hardest
Instrument</i> in the <i>World</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent">(2) &ldquo;That it will take up the Time of
an <i>Apprenticeship</i> to play <i>well</i> upon <i>It</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent">(3) &ldquo;That it makes <i>Young People</i>

<p class="gutindent">(4) &ldquo;That it is a very <i>Chargeable

<p class="gutindent">(5) &ldquo;That it is a <i>Woman&rsquo;s
Instrument</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent">(6) &ldquo;And lastly (which is the most
<i>Childish</i> of all the rest), It is out of
<i>Fashion</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>The following extracts from Mace will give some idea of
his style and of his method of treating the subject:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>First</i>, <i>know that an Old Lute is better than a
New one</i>: <i>Then</i>, <i>The Venice Lutes</i> are commonly
<i>Good</i>.&nbsp; There are diversities of <i>Mens Names</i> in
<i>Lutes</i>; but the <i>Chief Name</i> we most esteem, is
<i>Laux Maler</i>, ever written with <i>Text Letters</i>:
<i>Two</i> of which <i>Lutes</i> I have seen (<i>Pittifull
Old</i>, <i>Batter&rsquo;d</i>, <i>Crack&rsquo;d Things</i>)
valued at 100 l. <i>a piece</i> (p. 48).</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you perceive any <i>Peg</i> to be troubled with
the <i>slippery Disease</i>, assure yourself he will never grow
better of <i>Himself</i>, without some of <i>Your Care</i>;
therefore take <i>Him</i> out, and <i>examine</i> the
<i>Cause</i> (p. 51).</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that you may know how to <i>shelter your Lute</i>,
in the worst of <i>Ill weathers</i> (which is <i>moist</i>) you
shall do well . . . to put <i>It into a Bed</i>, <i>that is
constantly used</i>, <i>between the Rug and the Blanket</i>; but
<i>never</i> between the <i>sheets</i>, because they may be
<i>moist</i> with <i>Sweat</i> (p. 62).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strings are of three sorts, <i>Minikins</i>,
<i>Venice-Catlins</i>, <i>and Lyons</i> (for <i>Basses</i>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;I us&rsquo;d to compare . . . <i>Tossing-Finger&rsquo;d
Players</i> to <i>Blind-Horses</i>, which always <i>lift up their
Feet</i>, <i>higher than need is</i>; and so by that means,
<i>can never Run Fast</i>, or with a <i>Smooth
Swiftness</i>&rdquo; (p. 85).</p>
<p>He says, &ldquo;You must be <i>Very Careful</i> (now, in your
first beginning) to get a <i>Good Habit</i>; so that you <i>stop
close to your Fretts</i>, <i>and never upon any Frett</i>; <i>and

79</span>Bowed Instruments.</h3>
<p>Mr Galpin (p. 75) gives a figure of a man playing a Crowd with
a bow, instead of plucking the strings with the fingers as shown
in sculptured Irish Crosses.&nbsp; What makes the figure so
especially interesting, is that there is clearly no means of
<i>stopping</i> the strings, <i>i.e.</i>, of altering the length
of the vibrating region, and therefore altering the pitch.&nbsp;
No one, I fancy, would have guessed that the bow was of more
ancient lineage than the fiddle.&nbsp; The finger-board, which
transforms the instrument into an undeniable relative of the
violin, is known to have existed in the thirteenth century.&nbsp;
It is a striking fact that what is practically a cruit or rotte
survived in use until the nineteenth century in this country, in
the form of the Welsh <i>crwth</i> or crowd shown on Plate
III.&nbsp; There is a specimen dated 1742 in the Victoria and
Albert Museum.&nbsp; The crwth here figured was made last century
by Owain Tyddwr of Dolgelly, an old man who remembered the
instrument as it was in his younger days, and took great pleasure
in its reconstruction.</p>
<p>The crwth is followed by the rebec, which most of us know
better from Milton&rsquo;s lines&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When the merry bells ring round<br />
And the jocund rebecks sound&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>than in any more practical manner.&nbsp; It had a certain
resemblance to the lute in its pear-shaped outline and its convex
or rounded sound-box, but differs from that instrument in being
played with a bow.&nbsp; <!-- page 80--><a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>Mr Galpin
quotes very appropriately the name of one of the country actors
in <i>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>&mdash;Hugh
Rebeck&mdash;as suggesting that an everyday audience was familiar
with it.</p>
<p><i>Viols</i>.&mdash;The only surviving instrument of this
class is the double bass, which is &ldquo;still frequently made
with the flat back and sloping shoulders of its departed
predecessors.&rdquo;&nbsp; The bass viol was also known as the
Viola da Gamba, and this was Sir Andrew Aguecheek&rsquo;s
instrument, who was said to play on the &ldquo;Viol de
Gamboys.&rdquo;&nbsp; These instruments&mdash;bass and
treble&mdash;had six strings, and were provided with frets like
the guitar.&nbsp; Their tone is described as &ldquo;soft and
slightly reedy or nasal, but very penetrating.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
seems that the smaller viols disappeared in England towards the
end of the seventeenth century, but the type of viol
corresponding to the violoncello &ldquo;held its own for nearly
another hundred years,&rdquo; when it at last yielded to the more
modern instrument.</p>
<p>Under the heading &ldquo;Concerning the <i>Viol</i> and
<i>Musick</i> in general,&rdquo; Mace writes (p. 231):&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be thought, I am so great a <i>Lover of It</i>
[the Lute], that I make <i>Light Esteem</i> of any other
<i>Instrument</i>, besides; which <i>Truly</i> I do not; but
<i>Love the Viol</i> in a <i>very High Degree</i>; yea, close
unto the Lute. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot understand, how <i>Arts and Sciences</i>
should be subject unto any such <i>Phantastical</i>,
<i>Giddy</i>, or <i>Inconsiderate Toyish Conceits</i>, as ever to
be said to be <i>in Fashion</i>, <i>or out of Fashion</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember there was a <i>Fashion</i>, not many <!--
page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>Years since, for <i>Women in their Apparel</i> to be so
<i>Pent up by the Straitness</i>, <i>and Stiffness</i> of their
<i>Gown-Shoulder-Sleeves</i>, that <i>They</i> could not so much
as <i>Scratch their Heads</i> for the <i>Necessary Remove of a
Biting Louse</i>; nor <i>Elevate their Arms scarcely to feed
themselves Handsomely</i>; nor <i>Carve a Dish of Meat at a
Table</i>, but their <i>whole</i> Body must needs <i>Bend towards
the Dish</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here we must leave Thomas Mace (who with all his oddities
is a lovable and genuine writer) and pass on to the
&ldquo;scoulding&rdquo; violin&mdash;to use his own
phrase&mdash;an instrument he considered as only suitable for
&ldquo;any extraordinary Jolly or Jocund
Consort-Occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The violin, which finally ousted the treble viol, seems indeed
to have had a humble beginning in fairs and country revels: but
six violins were included in Henry VIII.&rsquo;s band, where they
were played by Italian musicians.&nbsp; Violins did not rapidly
make their way to popularity, and Playford (1660) describes these
instruments&mdash;rather condescendingly&mdash;as &ldquo;a
cheerful and spritely instrument much practised of
late.&rdquo;&nbsp; He speaks, too, of a bass violin, <i>i.e.</i>
the violoncello.</p>
<p>The chapter ends with a description of the tromba marina,
which is not marine trumpet, but a curious elongated box-like
instrument with a single string, which is sounded with a bow and
wakens the harmony of the sympathetic strings within the body of
the instrument.&nbsp; Mr Galpin&rsquo;s instrument was discovered
in an old farmhouse in Cheshire (Plate IV.).</p>
<p>Chapter vi. is chiefly devoted to the organistrum or <!-- page
82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>hurdy-gurdy (Plate V.).&nbsp; This is a stringed
instrument which differs from the rest of its class by being
sounded neither with fingers like the lute nor with a bow like
the viol, but by means of a rotating wooden wheel.&nbsp; The
melody string (or strings) is not stopped directly by the finger
as in the violin, but by a series of keys manipulated by the
performer, who need not necessarily possess a musical ear since
the stopping is arranged for him.&nbsp; The Swedish
nyckel-harpa&mdash;which I remember to have heard in
Stockholm&mdash;is the only other instrument in which the strings
are stopped by mechanical means.&nbsp; This instrument differs
from the organistrum in the fact that it is sounded by the
ordinary fiddle-bow, and not by means of a wheel.&nbsp; The
organistrum is remarkable for having been &ldquo;in constant and
popular use&rdquo; from the tenth century up to the present
day.</p>
<h3>Clavichord and Virginal.</h3>
<p>The clavichord, the earliest progenitor of the piano,
originated in an instrument in which the <i>tangent</i> which
struck a given string also acted as a bridge to mark off the
length of the vibrating portion and therefore to determine the
note produced.&nbsp; It is remarkable that (p. 115) this type of
instrument remained in use until the time of Sebastian Bach, when
the principle of &ldquo;one tangent one string&rdquo; replaced
the more ancient system.</p>
<p>Of the clavichord Mr Dolmetsch (p. 433) writes that its tone
is comparable, as regards colour and power, &ldquo;rather to the
humming of bees than to the most delicate among
instruments.&nbsp; But it possesses <!-- page 83--><a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>a soul . . .
for under the fingers of some gifted player it reflects every
shade of&rdquo; his &ldquo;feelings like a faithful mirror.&nbsp;
Its tone is alive, its notes can be swelled or made to quiver
just like a voice swayed by emotion.&nbsp; It can even command
those slight variations in pitch which in all sensitive
instruments are so helpful to expression.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>The best known among the group of instruments to which the
clavichord belongs are the spinet and the harpsichord.&nbsp; I
think that Browning&rsquo;s musician who &ldquo;played toccatas
stately at the clavichord&rdquo; must have performed on one of
the last-named instruments.&nbsp; In the spinet and the
harpsichord the strings are plucked, and therefore sounded, by
small points made of leather or of quill which are under the
control of the keyboard.</p>
<p>Mr Galpin (who is always interesting on evolution) points out
that the progenitor of the spinet is the plucked psaltery,
whereas the piano forte (the earliest form of which appeared
about 1709) is a descendant of the dulcimer in which the strings
were struck.</p>
<h3>Wind Instruments.</h3>
<p>One of the most ancient of wind instruments is the panpipe,
which used to be familiar in the Punch and Judy show of our
childhood, when it was accompanied by another ancient
instrument&mdash;the drum.&nbsp; The panpipe consists of a row of
reeds of graduated lengths which are closed at the lower end and
into which the performer blows, much as we used, as children, to
blow into a key and produce a shrill <!-- page 84--><a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>whistle.&nbsp; It is illustrated in an Anglo-Saxon
Psalter of the early eleventh century, which is preserved in the
Cambridge University Library.&nbsp; The whistle which we have all
made in our childhood by removing a tube of bark from a branch in
which the sap is rising, is an advance on the panpipes, since it
includes a method of producing a thin stream of air which
impinges on a sharp edge, whereas in the panpipes we depend on
our lips for the stream of air.&nbsp; These whistles are closed
at the lower end, and yield but a single note.&nbsp; But in the
tin penny whistle the tube is pierced by six holes for the
fingers, and on this instrument one may hear the itinerant artist
perform wonders.&nbsp; An instrument of this type, known as the
recorder, played a great part in the early orchestra.&nbsp; It
differs from the penny whistle in being made of wood, and in
having eight instead of six finger-holes; the additional ones
being for the left thumb and the little-finger of the right
hand.&nbsp; The recorder seems to have been especially popular in
England, indeed it was sometimes known as the <i>fistula
anglica</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the English pipe.&nbsp; The instrument
was made in different sizes; and I shall not easily forget the
astonishing beauty of a quartette of recorders played by Mr
Galpin and his family.&nbsp; In Plate VI. are shown the great
bass recorders, in regard to which the author is careful to point
out that the bassoon-like form shown in No. 1 and No. 5 does not
alter the pitch of the instrument, which depends on the length of
the tube measured from the fipple.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Mr Dolmetsch, in his book <!-- page 85--><a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span><i>The
Interpretation of the Music of the XVIlth and XVIIIth
Centuries</i>, p. 457, writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the first sound the recorder ingratiates itself into
the hearer&rsquo;s affection.&nbsp; It is sweet, full, profound,
yet clear, with just a touch of reediness, lest it should
cloy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The intonation . . . right through the chromatic
compass of two octaves and one note is perfect, if you know how
to manage the instrument; but its fingering is complicated, and
requires study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flageolet is the nearest living relative of the
recorder.&nbsp; What is known as the French flageolet is
especially reminiscent of the ancient instrument in having a
thumb-hole, or rather two such holes.&nbsp; It has the pleasant
archaic feature of its lowest note being produced by thrusting
the little finger of the right hand into the open end of the
tube.&nbsp; The most curious development of the flageolet is
found in the double or triple pipes which were made in the
closing years of the eighteenth century.&nbsp; I remember Mr
Galpin demonstrating the truth of his assertion that duets and
trios can be played on one of these curious instruments.</p>
<p>A much simpler instrument known as the tabor pipe <a
name="citation85"></a><a href="#footnote85"
class="citation">[85]</a> was in general use in the twelfth
century.&nbsp; Its essential feature is that it has but three
holes, so that it can be played with one hand, thus leaving the
other hand free to accompany the melody on the tabor or small
drum hung round the neck of the performer or from his
wrist.&nbsp; Its working compass <!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>is an octave
and three notes, though two shrieking higher notes can be
produced.&nbsp; The French form of three-holed pipe is known as
the galoubet.&nbsp; There was also a bass galoubet, which is
known from the figures in Praetorius (1618), and from one
solitary instrument which has escaped destruction.&nbsp; Mr
Galpin has a copy of it in his great collection, and I have had
the pleasure of playing on it.&nbsp; The instruments of the genus
recorder have been finally beaten in the struggle for life by the
flageolet, and perhaps especially by the true flute, which Mr
Galpin, for the sake of clearness, distinguishes as the cross
flute.&nbsp; It seems to be a mistake to consider the flute as a
modern instrument, as it was popular about the year 1500, and is
shown in an illuminated MS. of 1344 preserved at Oxford.</p>
<p>The flute as used about 1600 had but six holes, but the D# key
for the little finger of the right hand came into use about the
end of the seventeenth century, and about 1800 several keys had
been added to enable the performer to play with less
cross-fingering.</p>
<p>Dolmetsch, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 458, claims that although the
one-keyed flute of the eighteenth century has a weak tone, it is
more beautiful than the modern flute.</p>
<p>He adds that a flautist has recently studied this instrument,
guided by Hotteterre le Romain&rsquo;s book (1707), and can play
more perfectly in tune than &ldquo;he ever did before upon a
highly improved and most expensive modern instrument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The concert-flute of the present day is an elaborate <!-- page
87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>instrument covered with keys, and it has, I believe,
been suggested that its tone is injured by this
elaboration.&nbsp; Bass flutes have been made, one 3 ft. 7 ins.
in length is mentioned, whose lowest note was an octave below
middle C.</p>
<h3>Shawms. <a name="citation87"></a><a href="#footnote87"
class="citation">[87]</a></h3>
<p>The next class of wind instruments dealt with by the author is
that of which the oboe and bassoon are typical.&nbsp; Mr Galpin
refers to a reed-pipe with which I am very familiar; it is made
from a dandelion stalk pinched flat at one end.&nbsp; Its
principle is that of the oboe.&nbsp; I well remember admiring its
tone as a child, and lamenting its very brief life, for it soon
got spoiled.&nbsp; The reed of serious musical instruments is
made of two pieces of cane which are flat at the free or upper
end and terminate below in a tube which fits on to the
instrument.&nbsp; This is an ancient type of instrument, for the
Roman <i>tibia</i> is believed to have been played with the
&ldquo;double reed,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> of oboe-type.&nbsp; I may
here be allowed to quote from my <i>Rustic Sounds</i>, p. 5:
&ldquo;The most truly rustic instrument (and here I mean an
instrument of polite life&mdash;an orchestral instrument) is
undoubtedly the oboe.&nbsp; The bassoon runs it hard, but has a
touch of comedy and a strong flavour of necromancy, <!-- page
88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>while
the oboe is quite good and simple in nature and is excessively in
earnest; it seems to have in it the ghost of a sun-burnt boy
playing to himself under a tree, in a ragged shirt unbuttoned at
the throat.&rdquo;&nbsp; A figure is given (Galpin, p. 159) of a
goat playing on a shawm <a name="citation88"></a><a
href="#footnote88" class="citation">[88]</a> from a carving of
the twelfth century at Canterbury.&nbsp; The name is believed to
be derived from <i>calamaula</i>, a reed-pipe, which was
corrupted to <i>chalem-elle</i> and then to <i>shawm</i>.&nbsp;
Shawms were made of various sizes, from the small treble
instrument, one foot long, to the huge affair, six feet in
length.&nbsp; The name Howe-boie, <i>i.e.</i> probably Haut-bois,
was applied to the treble instrument as early as the reign of
Elizabeth; while the deeper-toned instruments retained the name
shawm.&nbsp; The bassoon is only a bass oboe rendered less
cumbrous by the tube being bent sharply on itself.&nbsp; A tenor
bassoon, known as the oboe da caccia, or teneroon, also existed,
and if my memory serves me right, Mr Stone rescued one of these
instruments from the band of a London boys&rsquo; school.&nbsp; A
teneroon of Mr Galpin&rsquo;s is shown at p. 168 of his book,
where it appears to be about seven-tenths of the size of the
ordinary bassoon.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The next class of wind-instrument is that of which the
clarinet is the modern representative.&nbsp; It has a rich but
somewhat cloying tone, and, to my thinking, none of the
mysterious charm of the oboe.&nbsp; It is characterised by a
single vibrating plate or reed, and the current of air from the
performer&rsquo;s mouth <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>passes between it and an immovable
surface of wood.&nbsp; In our country this type of reed was found
in a most interesting instrument, the horn-pipe <a
name="citation89a"></a><a href="#footnote89a"
class="citation">[89a]</a> or pibcorn, which is said to have
existed in Wales as late as the nineteenth century.&nbsp; One of
these curious instruments is in the possession of the Society of
Antiquaries, and is shown in Plate VII.&nbsp; It was given to the
Society by Daines Barrington, who describes it in the
Society&rsquo;s <i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i> for 1779.&nbsp; In a
Saxon vocabulary of the eighth century the word <i>Sambucus</i>
(<i>i.e.</i> elder-tree) is translated <i>swegelhorn</i>.&nbsp;
Now the word <i>swegel</i> was applied to the <i>tibia</i> or
leg-bone; it is therefore of remarkable interest to find that,
according to an old Welsh peasant, the tibia of a deer should be
the best tube for the pibcorn. <a name="citation89b"></a><a
href="#footnote89b" class="citation">[89b]</a>&nbsp; This name,
which means pipe-horn, is very appropriate, since the tube of the
instrument bears at either end a cow&rsquo;s horn.&nbsp; To the
upper one the performer applied his mouth.&nbsp; He had no means
of regulating the reed as a clarinet or oboe-player has; the reed
was left to its own sweet will, as is also the case with the
reeds in another ancient instrument&mdash;the bagpipe, to which a
few words must be given.</p>
<p>Mr Henry Balfour believes that both these instruments came to
us with the Keltic migration from the East.&nbsp; Or, as Mr
Galpin suggests, we may owe the bagpipe to Roman soldiers,
&ldquo;for the <i>tibia utricularis</i> was used in the Imperial
army.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is quite a mistake to suppose that the
bagpipe is in <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>any special way connected with
Scotland.&nbsp; Illuminated missals of the thirteenth,
fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries show how common the bagpipe
was in England.&nbsp; But the Scots must at least have a share of
the credit of preserving the bagpipe from extinction; and the
same may be said of another Keltic race, the Breton, in whose
land I have heard the bagpipe accompanied by a rough kind of
oboe.</p>
<p>Mr Galpin tells me a pleasant story of a bagpipe hunt in
Paris.&nbsp; He discovered, in a shop, an old French musette
(bagpipe), the chanter or melody-pipe of which was missing.&nbsp;
He did not buy it until in a two days&rsquo; hunt all over Paris
he discovered the lost chanter, when he returned to the first
shop, triumphantly carried off the musette, and thus became the
owner of this rare and beautiful instrument.</p>
<p>The drone, which forms a continuous bass to the
&ldquo;chanter,&rdquo; was not an original character of the
bagpipe, but appeared soon after the year 1300.&nbsp; A second
drone &ldquo;was added about the year 1400, for it is seen in the
ancient bagpipe belonging to Messrs Glen of Edinburgh,&rdquo;
which bears the date 1409.</p>
<h3>The Horn and Cornett.</h3>
<p>The horn takes its name from the cow&rsquo;s horn, out of
which the instrument was made.&nbsp; The resemblance includes the
tapering bore of this instrument, and also the fact that it is
curved. <a name="citation90"></a><a href="#footnote90"
class="citation">[90]</a>&nbsp; In the metal <!-- page 91--><a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>instruments,
made in imitation of the natural horn, we find a curvature of
about a semi-circle, as in the seventeenth century hunting horn
(Galpin, p. 188).&nbsp; While in the horn of the early
seventeenth century shown on the same plate, the tube is curved
into many circular coils.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The cornett, <a name="citation91"></a><a href="#footnote91"
class="citation">[91]</a> which was blown like a horn or trumpet,
seems to have been successful in medi&aelig;val times, because a
workable scale was so much more easily attainable with it than in
the ordinary trumpet.&nbsp; In Norway a goat&rsquo;s horn pierced
with four or five holes stopped by the fingers is still in use as
a rustic instrument.&nbsp; This is in fact a cornett which, as
early as the twelfth century, was made of wood or ivory, and had
a characteristic six-sided form.&nbsp; It seems to have been
popular, and Henry VIII. died possessed of many cornetts.&nbsp;
We hear, too, of two <i>Cornetters</i> attached to Canterbury
Cathedral; and the translators of the Bible gave it a place in
Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s band.&nbsp; But the cornett was doomed to
destruction in the struggle for life.&nbsp; In 1662 Evelyn speaks
of the disappearance of the cornett &ldquo;which gave life to the
organ.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lord Keeper North wrote, &ldquo;Nothing comes
so near, or rather imitates so much, an excellent voice as a
cornett pipe; but the labour of the lips is too great and is
seldom well-sounded.&rdquo;&nbsp; The cornett was given a place
in the chorales of Bach and the operas of Gluck after it had
become extinct in England.</p>
<p>The bass cornett was known as the serpent from its <!-- page
92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>curved form, and this character was in fact necessary in
order that the performer&rsquo;s hands might be nearer
together.&nbsp; Mr Galpin writes:&mdash;&ldquo;If not overblown
it yields a peculiarly soft <i>woody</i> tone which no longer has
its counterpart in the orchestra.&rdquo;&nbsp; He quotes from
Thomas Hardy&rsquo;s <i>Under the Greenwood Tree</i>, where the
village shoemaker remarks, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s worse things than
serpents.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr Stone (<i>Dictionary of Music</i>,
1883) wrote:&mdash;&ldquo;There were till a few years ago two
serpents in the band of the Sacred Harmonic Society, played by Mr
Standen and Mr Pimlett.&rdquo;&nbsp; The serpent <a
name="citation92"></a><a href="#footnote92"
class="citation">[92]</a> was driven out of the orchestra by the
Ophicleide, which again has been extinguished by the valved Tubas
of Adolphe Sax.</p>
<h3>Trumpet and Sackbut.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The story of the trumpet is the story of panoply and
pomp,&rdquo; says Mr Galpin, and goes on to explain how the
trumpeters with drummers formed an exclusive guild.&nbsp;
Trumpets served as war-like instruments, but also for domestic
pomp.&nbsp; Thus twelve trumpets and two kettle-drums sounded
while Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s dinner was being brought in.&nbsp;
That monarch had certainly no excuse for being late for her
meals.</p>
<p>The trumpet was originally a long straight <!-- page 93--><a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>cylindrical
tube, but as early as 1300 the tube was bent into a loop, thus
combining length with handiness.&nbsp; This form of the
instrument was known as a clarion, a word which has degenerated
in our day into a picturesque word for a trumpet.&nbsp; It was
for the clarion that Bach and Handel wrote trumpet parts which, I
gather, are almost unplayable on the modern instrument.&nbsp; The
clarion seems to have been soon beaten in the struggle for life
by the clarinet, &ldquo;which, as its name implies, was
considered an effective substitute for the high clarion
notes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sackbut, <i>i.e.</i> trombone, is an important offshoot
from the trumpet.&nbsp; The essential feature of this splendid
instrument is that the length of the tube can be altered at
will.&nbsp; Thus the performer is not&mdash;like the
trumpeter&mdash;confined to one series of harmonics, but can take
advantage of a whole series of these accessory notes.</p>
<h3>The Organ.</h3>
<p>This is one of the most ancient of instruments.&nbsp; Thus in
the second century before our era Ctesibius of Alexandria had a
simple type of organ, in which the wind from the bellows was
admitted at will into whistle-like tube by keys which the
performer depressed with his fingers.&nbsp; It is a remarkable
fact that keys should afterwards have been replaced by cumbersome
<i>sliders</i> which had to be pushed in and out to produce the
desired note.&nbsp; But so it was, and the keyboard had to be
rediscovered in the twelfth century.&nbsp; The keys were first
<!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>applied to the little portatives, <a
name="citation94a"></a><a href="#footnote94a"
class="citation">[94a]</a> one of which is figured by Galpin, p.
221, where the organist works the wind supply with one hand and
manipulates the keys with the other.&nbsp; In Galpin, p. 222, a
monk is shown playing a simple organ of apparently two octave
compass, while another tonsured person is blowing a pair of
bellows, one with the left and the other with the right
hand.&nbsp; Another artist is shown by Galpin, p. 226, from a
thirteenth century Psalter, who is accompanying a player of the
symphony (hurdy-gurdy).&nbsp; The bellows are blown by the feet
of an assistant.</p>
<p>The regal, figured by Galpin at p. 230, was a simple form of
organ in which the pipes were not of the whistle-type, but
consisted principally of reed-pipes.</p>
<h3>Tabors and Nakers.</h3>
<p>In my essay on war music <a name="citation94b"></a><a
href="#footnote94b" class="citation">[94b]</a> I wrote of the
band of a French regiment at the beginning of the war:
&ldquo;When the buglers were out of breath, the drums thundered
on with magnificent fire, until once more the simple and spirited
fanfare came in with its brave out-of-doors flavour&mdash;a
romantic dash of the hunting-song, and yet with something of the
seriousness of battle. . . .&nbsp; As I watched these men, so
soon to fight for their country, I was reminded of that
white-faced boy pictured by Stevenson, striding over his dead
comrades, the roll of his drum <!-- page 95--><a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>leading the
living to victory or death.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have ventured to quote
the above passage in illustration of Mr Galpin&rsquo;s striking
remark that the drum has probably entered more largely than any
other instrument into the destinies of the human race.</p>
<p>The historian of musical instruments in the far north has an
easy task, since it appears that the Eskimoes confine themselves
to the drum, which they sound on all possible occasions, from
prosperous huntings to the death of a comrade.</p>
<p>The instruments of the class here dealt with are divided into
three types:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">(i.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The timbrel or tambourine,
which is characterised by having only one membrane stretched on a
shallow wooden frame.</p>
<p class="gutindent">(ii.)&nbsp; The drum with two membranes, one
at each end of a barrel-shaped frame.</p>
<p class="gutindent">(iii.) The naker or kettle-drum, with a
single membrane stretched over the opening of a hemispherical
frame.&nbsp; The tambourine is an extremely ancient instrument
since it was known in Assyria and Egypt as well as in Greece and
Rome, and it is especially interesting to learn that the Roman
tambourine had the metal discs which make so exciting a jingle in
the modern instrument.&nbsp; The medi&aelig;val tambourine also
had what, in the case of the drum, is called the <i>snare</i>,
which is a cord tightly stretched across the membrane, and gives
a certain sting to instruments of this class, but now only exists
in the drum proper.</p>
<h3><!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>Drum.</h3>
<p>An ancient Egyptian drum was discovered at Thebes.&nbsp; It
was a true drum having a membrane at each end of the hollow
cylinder which made the frame, and, what is more remarkable, it
had the braces or system of cords by which we still tighten the
drum-membranes.</p>
<p>The drum &ldquo;suspended at the side of the player and beaten
on one head only&rdquo; became, with the accompaniment of the
fife, the earliest type of military music. <a
name="citation96a"></a><a href="#footnote96a"
class="citation">[96a]</a>&nbsp; Mr Galpin concludes <a
name="citation96b"></a><a href="#footnote96b"
class="citation">[96b]</a> by quoting what Virdung (1511) had to
say of drums: &ldquo;I verily believe that the devil must have
had the devising and making of them, for there is no pleasure nor
anything good about them.&nbsp; If the noise of the drum-stick be
music, then the coopers who make barrels must be
musicians.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Kettle-drums. <a name="citation96c"></a><a
href="#footnote96c" class="citation">[96c]</a></h3>
<p>Anyone who has seen the band of the Life Guards must have
admired (as I do) the splendid personage who plays the
kettle-drums.&nbsp; These are not of the ordinary drum-form,
being hemispherical instead of cylindrical, and having but a
single membrane.&nbsp; They have a right to be called musical
instruments since their pitch is alterable: <a
name="citation96d"></a><a href="#footnote96d"
class="citation">[96d]</a> I have often admired <!-- page 97--><a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>the drummer
in an orchestra tuning his instrument at a change of key.&nbsp;
One sees him leaning over his children like an anxious mother
until he gets his large babies into the proper temper.</p>
<p>The earliest record of kettle-drums in this country is in the
list of Edward I.&rsquo;s musicians, among whom was Janino le
Nakerer.&nbsp; Henry VIII. is said to have sent to Vienna for
kettle-drums <a name="citation97"></a><a href="#footnote97"
class="citation">[97]</a> that could be played on horseback in
the Hungarian manner.&nbsp; In England, Handel was the first to
use the kettle-drum in the concert-room, and he used to borrow
from the Tower the drums taken from the French at the battle of
Malplaquet in 1709.</p>
<h3>Cymbals and Chimes.</h3>
<p>The cymbals are of a great antiquity, being depicted on
ancient Assyrian monuments, and &ldquo;in the British Museum may
be seen a pair of bronze cymbals which once did duty for the
sacred rites of Egyptian deities.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are figured
in English MSS. of the thirteenth century, and Mr Galpin gives a
figure of a cymbal-player (as shown in a fourteenth century MS.)
vigorously clashing his instrument.&nbsp; There was also an
apparatus known as a jingling johnny, figured by Galpin at p.
258.&nbsp; It was a pole bearing a number of bells, hence the
name which it doubtless deserved.&nbsp; The crescents with which
it is decorated are an inheritance from its forbears of the
Janizary bands.</p>
<p><!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>Mr Galpin ends his book with a very interesting chapter
on the <i>Consort</i>, <i>i.e.</i> Concert, which, however, does
not lend itself to that abbreviation to which the rest of the
book has been mercilessly subjected.</p>

99</span>THE TRADITIONAL NAMES OF ENGLISH PLANTS</h2>
<p>I do not pretend to be a specialist in the study of
plant-names.&nbsp; But there is something to be said for
ignorance (in moderation), since it brings reader and writer more
closely together than is the case when the author knows the last
word in a subject of which the reader knows nothing.&nbsp; But we
need not consider the case of the blankly ignorant reader, and I
can undertake that (for very sufficient reasons) I shall not be
offensively learned.</p>
<p>The fact that language is handed on from one generation to the
next may remind us of heredity, and the way in which words change
is a case of variation.&nbsp; But we cannot understand what
determines the extinction of old words or the birth of new
ones.&nbsp; We cannot, in fact, understand how the principle of
natural selection is applicable to language: yet there must be a
survival of the fittest in words, as in living creatures.&nbsp;
Language is a quality of man, and just as we can point to big
racial groups such as that which includes the English, Dutch,
Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Icelandic and German peoples, so
their languages, though differing greatly in detail, have certain
well-marked resemblances.&nbsp; <!-- page 100--><a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>Of course I
do not mean to imply that language is hereditary, like the form
of skull or the colour of the hair.&nbsp; I only insist on these
familiar facts in order to show that the wonderful romance
inherent in the great subject of evolution also illumines that
cycle of birth and death to which existing plant-names are
due.</p>
<p>In the case of living creatures we can at least make a guess
as to what are the qualities that have made them succeed in the
struggle for life.&nbsp; But in the case of the birth and death
of words we are surrounded with difficulties.</p>
<p>In some instances, however, it is clear that plant-names were
forgotten with the growth of Protestantism.&nbsp; The common
milk-wort used to be called the Gang-flower <a
name="citation100a"></a><a href="#footnote100a"
class="citation">[100a]</a> because it blossoms in what our
ancestors called Gang Week,&mdash;&ldquo;three days before the
Ascension, when processions were made . . . to perambulate the
parishes with the Holy Cross and Litanies, to mark their
boundaries, and invoke the blessing of God on the crops.&rdquo;
<a name="citation100b"></a><a href="#footnote100b"
class="citation">[100b]</a>&nbsp; Bishop Kennet says that the
girls made garlands of milk-wort and used them &ldquo;in those
solemn processions.&rdquo;&nbsp; As far as dates are concerned
the name is fairly appropriate, for Rogation Sunday is 27th
April, <i>i.e.</i> 10th May, old style, and, according to
Blomefield, <a name="citation100c"></a><a href="#footnote100c"
class="citation">[100c]</a> from eight <!-- page 101--><a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>years&rsquo; observation, the milk-wort flowers on 15th
May.&nbsp; The milk-wort is a small plant, and the labour of
making garlands from it must have been considerable.&nbsp; There
must have been a reason for using a blue flower, and I gather
from a friend learned in such matters that blue is associated
with the Virgin Mary, to whom the month of May is dedicated.</p>
<p>In this case we can perhaps understand why the name should
have all but died out with the disappearance of these old
ceremonies.&nbsp; But why should the name <i>milk-wort</i> have
survived?&nbsp; Its scientific name, Polygala, is derived from
Greek and means &ldquo;much milk,&rdquo; and the plant was
supposed to encourage lactation.&nbsp; It is an instance of names
being more long-lived than the beliefs which they chronicle.</p>
<p>There are, of course, many plants called after saints.&nbsp;
Thus the pig-nut (<i>Bunium</i>) is called St Anthony&rsquo;s
nut, because, as quoted by Prior, &ldquo;The wretched
Antonius&rdquo; was &ldquo;forced to mind the filthy herds of
swine.&rdquo;&nbsp; The buttercup (<i>R. bulbosus</i>) was called
St Anthony&rsquo;s turnip from its tubers being said to be eaten
by pigs.</p>
<p>St Catherine&rsquo;s flower (<i>Nigella</i>) (generally known
as love-in-a-mist or devil-in-a-bush) is called after the martyr
from the arrangement of its styles, which recall the spokes of St
Catherine&rsquo;s wheel.&nbsp; I do not <!-- page 102--><a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>mean the
well-known fireworks but the instrument of torture on which the
saint died.&nbsp; St James&rsquo; wort is the yellow daisy-like
flower <i>Senecio Jacob&aelig;a</i>, known as rag-wort.&nbsp; It
is said to have been used as a cure for the diseases of horses,
of which he was the patron.</p>
<p>In the old herbals the cowslip is called St Peter&rsquo;s wort
from the resemblance of the flowers to a bunch of keys&mdash;no
doubt the keys of heaven, of which Peter is custodian.</p>
<p>A number of plants were called after the Virgin Mary: these
were doubtless known as Our Lady&rsquo;s flowers, but their names
have been corrupted in Protestant days by the omission of the
pronoun.</p>
<p>Lady&rsquo;s fingers (<i>Anthyllis vulneraria</i>) is a common
enough plant bearing a head or tuft of yellow flowers.&nbsp; Each
has a pale swollen calyx, and these are, I suppose, the fingers
on which the name is founded, though I find it said that it
originates in the leaflets surrounding the flower head.</p>
<p>Butcher&rsquo;s broom is known in Wales as Mary&rsquo;s holly,
the latter half of the name referring to its red berries and
prickly leaves.&nbsp; It was used to clean butcher&rsquo;s
blocks.</p>
<p>Lady&rsquo;s slipper is so named from the strikingly shoe-like
form of the flower.&nbsp; It is excessively rare in England, but
in Southern France one may see great bunches gathered for sale,
over which, by the way, I have often mourned.</p>
<p>Lady&rsquo;s tresses (the orchid <i>Spiranthes</i>) is so
named from the curious twisted or braided arrangement of the
flowers.</p>
<p><!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>Lady&rsquo;s smock (<i>Cardamine pratensis</i>) bears a
name immortalised in Shakespeare&rsquo;s song:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When daisies pied and violets blue,<br />
And lady&rsquo;s smocks all silver white,<br />
And cuckow-buds of yellow hue<br />
Do paint the meadows with delight.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suspect that the poet called them <i>silver white</i> to
rhyme with <i>delight</i>, for they are distinctly lilac in
colour.&nbsp; Nor are they especially smock-like&mdash;many other
flowers suggest a woman&rsquo;s skirt equally well&mdash;but this
is a carping criticism.</p>
<p>Lady&rsquo;s bedstraw seems to have been so called from the
yellow colour of one or more kinds of Galium.</p>
<p>Lady&rsquo;s bower is <i>Clematis vitalba</i>, now known as
traveller&rsquo;s joy.&nbsp; Anyone exploring Seven Leases Lane,
which runs along the edge of the Cotswolds, will travel in
continuous joy, for the lady&rsquo;s bower converts many hundred
yards of hedge into continuous beauty.</p>
<p><i>Pulmonaria</i> has been called the Virgin Mary&rsquo;s
tears, from the pale circular marks on its leaves.&nbsp; The blue
flowers have been supposed to typify the beautiful eyes of the
Virgin, while the red buds are the same eyes disfigured with
weeping.</p>
<p>Many plants are named after the devil; there is, for instance,
a species of <i>Scabiosa</i> called devil&rsquo;s bit, because
that eminent personage bit the root short off, and so it remains
to this day.&nbsp; His object seems to have been to destroy the
medicinal properties the plant was supposed to possess.</p>
<p>We now pass on to plants flowering on certain <!-- page
104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>dates, such as Saints&rsquo; days or other church
festivals.&nbsp; The snowdrop has been called the Fair Maid of
February, because it was supposed to flower on Candlemas Day, 2nd
February, which would be 15th February according to the modern
calendar.</p>
<p>The name St John&rsquo;s wort, which we habitually apply to
several species of <i>Hypericum</i>, is correctly used only for
<i>H. perforatum</i>.&nbsp; Its English name is said to have been
given from its flowering on St John&rsquo;s Day, 24th June.&nbsp;
This would be 7th July, new style, and I find that
Blomefield&rsquo;s average of eight annual observations is 4th
July.</p>
<p>I had been wondering why there seemed to be no name for St
John&rsquo;s wort suggested by the glands, which show as pellucid
dots when the leaf is held up to the light.&nbsp; And in Britten
and Holland&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary of English Plant Names</i>,
1886, I found that <i>H. perforatum</i> was called Balm of
Warrior&rsquo;s Wound, which must refer to the innumerable stabs
it exhibits, though they are more numerous than most warriors can
endure.&nbsp; A closely related plant is <i>Hypericum
andros&aelig;mum</i>, known as Tutsan, said to mean <i>toute
saine</i>, as curing all hurts.&nbsp; In Wales, as I well
remember forty years ago, the leaves were kept in bibles.&nbsp;
They are, as I learn from a Welsh scholar, known as Blessed
One&rsquo;s leaves.</p>
<p>The common yellow wayside plant <i>Geum urbanum</i> is known
as Herb Benet, because, like St Benet, it had the power of
counteracting the effect of poison.</p>
<p>The sweet-william is said by Forster to be so named from
flowering on St William&rsquo;s Day, 25th June.&nbsp; But
Blomefield&rsquo;s date is 17th June, which would <!-- page
105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>be
4th June, old style.&nbsp; A much more probable explanation is
that William is a corruption of the French name
<i>&oelig;illet</i>, a word derived from the Latin
<i>ocellus</i>, a little eye.&nbsp; So that the ancestry of the
name runs
thus:&mdash;<i>Ocellus</i>&mdash;&oelig;illet&mdash;Willy&mdash;William.</p>
<p>Oxalis, the wood-sorrel, was known as hallelujah, not only in
England but in several parts of the Continent, from its
blossoming between Easter and Whitsuntide, when psalms were sung
ending in the word hallelujah.</p>
<h3>Historical.</h3>
<p>Some plant-names take us back to historical personages.&nbsp;
The Carline thistle is named after Karl the Great, better known
as Charlemagne.&nbsp; There was a pestilence in his army, and in
answer to his prayer an angel appeared and shot, from a crossbow,
a bolt, which fell on the Carline thistle with which the Emperor
proceeded to conquer the pestilence.</p>
<p>Another magical arrow-shot is described in well-known lines in
<i>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</i> (Act ii., scene I).&nbsp;
Oberon speaks of Cupid loosing his &ldquo;love shaft smartly from
the bow&rdquo; at &ldquo;a fair vestal throned in the
west.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cupid missed his mark, and the poet
continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid
fell:<br />
It fell upon a little western flower,<br />
Before milk-white, now purple with love&rsquo;s wound,<br />
And maidens call it Love-in-idleness.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The name Love-in-idleness should be Love-in-idle if the metre
could have allowed it.&nbsp; This means love-in-vain: witness the
Anglo-Saxon bible, where occurs <!-- page 106--><a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>the phrase
to take God&rsquo;s name &ldquo;in idle.&rdquo;&nbsp; The flower
referred to by Shakespeare is doubtless the pansy.</p>
<p>Some names recall the work of more modern people.&nbsp; Thus
the wild chamomile was known in the Eastern counties as
<i>Mawther</i>; and this, as all lovers of Dickens will remember,
means not a mother but a girl; and the name is in fact a
translation of the Greek Parthenion into the Suffolk dialect.</p>
<p>The elder used to be known as the <i>bour-tree</i>.&nbsp; I
fear that the name is extinct in England, but a Scotch friend
tells me that he was familiar with it in his youth.&nbsp; I love
this name because it is associated in my mind with the words of
Meg Merrilees <a name="citation106"></a><a href="#footnote106"
class="citation">[106]</a> in <i>Guy Mannering</i>, the first
English classic in which I took pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, on this very spot the man fell from his
horse&mdash;I was behind the bour-tree bush at the very
moment.&nbsp; Sair, sair he strove, and sair he cried for mercy;
but he was in the hands of them that never kenn&rsquo;d the
word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The actual origin of the name is, however, not romantic; it is
said to mean <i>bore</i>, and to refer to the fact that tubes
were made from it by boring out the pith.&nbsp; It seems possible
that such tubes were, in primitive times, used to blow the fire,
and this would explain the name elder, which seems to mean
<i>kindler</i>.</p>
<p>The dwarf elder, a distinct species, though not connected with
an individual, commemorates a race, <!-- page 107--><a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>being known
as Dane&rsquo;s blood.&nbsp; It grows on the Bartlow Hills, near
Cambridge, where tradition says that Danes were killed in
battle.</p>
<p>I add a few names as being picturesque, though without any
literary associations.</p>
<p>There is an old name for the shepherd&rsquo;s purse, viz.,
clapperde-pouch, which is said to allude to the leper who stood
at the cross-ways announcing his presence with a bell and
clapper, and begged for pennies to put in his pouch, which is
typified by the seed capsule.&nbsp; Another name for the plant is
mother&rsquo;s heart, <a name="citation107"></a><a
href="#footnote107" class="citation">[107]</a> and is no doubt
referable to the shape of the seed pod.&nbsp; Children in
England, also in Germany and Switzerland, used to play at the
simple game of asking a companion to gather a pod, and then
jeering at him for having plucked out his mother&rsquo;s
heart.</p>
<p>The name columbine comes from the flower&rsquo;s obvious
resemblance to a group of doves, and its Latin name
<i>aquilegia</i>, meaning a collection of eagles, is a nobler
form of the same idea.</p>
<p>Dead-man&rsquo;s fingers is a fine uncanny name for the
innocent <i>Orchis maculata</i>, and refers to its branching
white tuber.</p>
<p>Garlick is a very ancient name, being derived from the
Anglo-Saxon <i>gar</i>, a spear, and <i>leac</i>, a plant; in the
name house-leek the word still bears its original meaning of a
plant.</p>
<p><i>Tragopogon</i>, the goat&rsquo;s beard, which closes its
flowers about mid-day, was once known as go-to-bed-at-noon.</p>
<p><!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>The pansy has been called Herb trinity from the triple
colouring of its petals.&nbsp; In Welsh, and also in German, the
pansy is called stepmother.&nbsp; The lower petal is the most
decorative, and this is the stepmother herself.&nbsp; On
examining the back of the flower it will be seen that she is
supported by two green leaflets, known as the
<i>sepals</i>.&nbsp; These are called her two chairs.&nbsp; Then
come her two daughters, less smart, and having only a chair
apiece.&nbsp; Lastly, the two step-daughters, still more plainly
dressed and with but one chair between them.</p>
<p>Polemonium, from its numerous leaflets arranged in pairs, has
received the picturesque name of Jacob&rsquo;s ladder.&nbsp; I
remember the pleasure with which I first saw it growing wild in
the hayfields of the Engadine.</p>
<p>Polygonatum, <i>i.e.</i> Solomon&rsquo;s seal, has been
christened <i>Scala c&oelig;li</i>, the ladder to heaven, on the
same principle.&nbsp; The name Solomon&rsquo;s seal is not
obviously appropriate till we dig up the plant, when the
underground stem is found marked with curious scars, which,
however, should be pentagonal if they are to represent
Solomon&rsquo;s pentacle.</p>
<p>Herb twopence (<i>Lysimchia nummularia</i>) is so named after
the round leaflets arranged in pairs along its creeping
stalk.&nbsp; I do not know why <i>Inula conyza</i> is called
ploughman&rsquo;s spikenard, but it is a picturesque name.</p>
<p>Everyone knows the garden plant touch-me-not, so called from
the curious irritability of its pods, which writhe in an uncanny
way when we gather them.&nbsp; This quality is expressed twice
over in the Latin name <i>Impatiens noli-me-tangere</i>.&nbsp;
But there is a <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>forgotten old English name which
pleases me more, viz., quick-in-the-hand, that is to say
alive-in-the-hand.&nbsp; This use of the word survives in the
familiar phrase &ldquo;the quick and the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The English name of <i>Echium vulgare</i> is viper&rsquo;s
bugloss&mdash;this I had always imagined referred to the forked
tongue (the style) which projects from the flower.&nbsp; But it
is said to be so named from the seeds resembling a viper&rsquo;s
head.&nbsp; This is certainly the case, and what can be the
function of the little knobs on the seed, which represent eyes, I
cannot imagine.&nbsp; The name bugloss is derived from the Greek
and means ox-tongue&mdash;no doubt in reference to the
plant&rsquo;s rough leaves.</p>
<p><i>Corruptions</i>.&mdash;Another and greater class of names
comprises those which are corruptions of classical names or of
those unfamiliar in other ways.</p>
<p>A well-known example is daffodil, which was originally
affodyl, a corruption of asphodel, a name of unknown meaning,
originally given to the iris, and transferred to narcissus.&nbsp;
A very obvious corruption is aaron, which has been applied to
Lords and Ladies, whose scientific name is Arum.&nbsp; An
incomprehensibly foolish instance is bullrush for pool-rush,
<i>i.e.</i> water rush.&nbsp; This name has at least the merit of
supplying material for that riddle of our childhood in which
occur the words &ldquo;when the bull rushes out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carraway is another obvious corruption of its Latin name
<i>Carum carui</i>.&nbsp; In the ancient <i>Schola
Salernitana</i>, as I learn from Sir Norman Moore, is a punning
Latin line, &ldquo;Dum carui carwey non sine <!-- page 110--><a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>febre
fui&rdquo; (&ldquo;When I was out of carraway I was never free
from fever&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Dogwood (<i>Cornus sanguinea</i>) was originally dagwood, so
called because it was used to make <i>dags</i> or skewers:
doubtless the same word as dagger.&nbsp; According to a Welsh
tradition dogwood was the tree on which the devil hung his
mother.&nbsp; I cannot resist the pleasure of quoting this fact,
although it does not bear on anything in particular.</p>
<p>Eglantine, a name used for the wild rose, is with much
probability derived from the Latin <i>aculentus</i>, prickly,
which became in French <i>aiglent</i>.&nbsp; Hence came the
French names of the plant <i>eglantier</i> and our
<i>eglantine</i>.</p>
<p>Gooseberry is believed not to have anything to do with a
goose, but to come from the Flemish <i>Kroes</i>, meaning a
cross, a comparison said to be suggested by the triple thorns,
though of course a fourth thorn is needed to make this simile
accurate.&nbsp; It is hard to see why a plant which grows wild in
England, and seems by some botanists to be considered indigenous,
should have a Flemish name.&nbsp; Prior, our chief authority,
asserts that the early herbalists constantly took names from
continental writers, and I think his judgment may be
trusted.&nbsp; The problem of the derivation of the word
gooseberry may at least serve to illustrate the difficulty of the
subject.</p>
<p>The name <i>Hemlock</i>, which nowadays has a wicked poisonous
sound, has in truth a very innocent origin.&nbsp; It is
compounded of <i>hem</i>, <i>i.e.</i> haulm, a stalk, and
<i>lock</i>, or leac, a plant, thus signifying merely a plant
with a stem.&nbsp; Jack of the Buttery, a name applied to <!--
page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span><i>Sedum acre</i>, is said to be a corruption from
<i>bot</i>, <i>i.e.</i> an internal parasite, and <i>theriac</i>,
by which was meant a cure for that evil.&nbsp; The last-named
word has turned into &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; and <i>bot</i> has grown
into &ldquo;buttery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamb&rsquo;s tongue is said to be a name for <i>Plantago
media</i>; but this must, I think, be a corruption of land
tongue, which is highly appropriate to the tongue-like leaves
lying so closely appressed to the soil that no blade of grass
grows under them, as though they were determined to spite any one
who should root them up by disfiguring his lawn with naked
patches.&nbsp; But still better evidence is forthcoming in the
fact that my old Cambridgeshire gardener always called them land
tongues.&nbsp; Why the Anglo-Saxons used the name <i>way
bread</i> for the plantain I do not see: the fact is vouched for
by Cockayne in his book entitled <i>Leechdoms</i>.</p>
<p>In Gloucestershire the plantain is called the
<i>fire-leaf</i>, a name which records the belief that plantains
are a danger in the way of heating hay-stacks.</p>
<p>The word madder, <i>i.e.</i> the name of the plant which
supplies the red dye for the trousers of our French allies, has a
curious history.&nbsp; Madder is derived from <i>mad</i>, a worm,
and should therefore be applied to cochineal, the red colouring
matter produced by the minute creature called a coccus.&nbsp; But
still more confusion meets us: the word vermilion which is now
used for a red colour of mineral origin, is derived from
<i>vermis</i>, a worm, and should therefore also be applied to
cochineal.&nbsp; The word pink, one of the most familiar of
plant-names, has a curious origin, being simply the German <!--
page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span><i>Pfingst</i>, a corruption of Pentecost, <i>i.e.</i>
the fiftieth day after Easter.</p>
<p>The tendency to make some kind of sense, or at least something
familiar, from the unfamiliar, comes out in name service-tree
(<i>Pyrus torminalis</i>).&nbsp; It has nothing to do with
<i>service</i>, being simply a corruption of <i>cerevisia</i>, a
fermented liquor.&nbsp; The fruit was used for brewing what
Evelyn in his <i>Sylva</i>, chap. xv., declares it to be, an
incomparable drink.&nbsp; Prior says that the French name of the
tree, <i>cormier</i>, is derived from an ancient Gaulish word
<i>courmi</i>, which seems to suggest the modern Welsh
<i>cwrw</i>, beer.</p>
<p>Tansy (<i>Tanacetum</i>) is believed to be simply a corruption
of <i>athansia</i>, immortality.&nbsp; I gather that we got the
name through the French <i>athanasie</i>, in which, of course,
the <i>th</i> is sounded as a <i>t</i>.&nbsp; In all probability
it was originally applied to some plant more deserving of being
credited with immortality.</p>
<p>A few miscellaneous names may here be given.&nbsp; <i>Thorough
wax</i> is a name for <i>Chlora perfoliata</i>, also known as
<i>yellow wort</i>.&nbsp; Its leaves are perfoliate, <i>i.e.</i>
opposite and united by their bases so that the stem seems to have
grown through a single leaf.</p>
<p><i>Kemps</i>, <i>i.e.</i> warriors, was a name of the common
plantain, with which children used to fight one against the
other.&nbsp; I remember this as being an unsatisfactory game
because one so constantly killed one&rsquo;s own kemp instead of
the enemy.</p>
<p><i>Herb Paris</i> is simply the plant with a pair of leaves;
it should, however, have been described as having four
leaves.&nbsp; Thus the name has nothing to <!-- page 113--><a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>do with
Paris, the capital of France.&nbsp; But some plants have names of
geographical origin; the currants or minute grapes used for
making cakes are so called because they come from Corinth.&nbsp;
So that we are quite wrong in applying this same name to the
familiar companion of the gooseberry in our gardens.&nbsp; In the
same way damsons are so called because they are said to have come
originally from Damascus.</p>
<p>The name Canterbury bell has a very interesting origin,
namely, that bells were the recognised badge of pilgrims to the
shrine of St Thomas at Canterbury.&nbsp; One of these bells was
found in the bed of the Thames when old London Bridge was pulled
down.&nbsp; It is said to be &ldquo;about the size of an ordinary
handbell, with a flat top, on which is an open handle, through
which a strap could easily be passed to attach it to a
horse&rsquo;s collar.&rdquo;&nbsp; This bell is known to have
been associated with Canterbury by the inscription <i>Campana
Thome</i> on the outer edge.&nbsp; The pilgrims seem to have
journeyed cheerfully.&nbsp; It is written that some
&ldquo;pilgrims will have with them bag-pipes; so that in everie
towne they come through, what with the noise of their piping, and
the jangling of their <i>Canterburie bells</i>, etc., they make
more noise than if the king came there away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dutch mice is a name for <i>Lathyrus tuberosus</i>.&nbsp;
Gerard says that the plant is so named from the &ldquo;similitude
or likeness of Domesticall Mise, which the blacke, rounde, and
long nuts, with a peece of the slender string hanging out behind
do represent.&rdquo;&nbsp; From this description one would expect
to see <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>mouse-like pods, but it is the
tubers which give the name to the plant.&nbsp; This is clearly
visible in Bentham&rsquo;s illustration; <a
name="citation114"></a><a href="#footnote114"
class="citation">[114]</a> I hope the artist was unaware of the
name when he made the drawing&mdash;but I have my doubts.&nbsp;
The specimen from Cambridgeshire (which I owe to the kindness of
Mr Shrubbs of the University Herbarium) are not especially
mouse-like.</p>
<p>The names shepherd&rsquo;s needle and Venus&rsquo; comb have
been given to an umbelliferous plant, <i>Scandix
Pecten</i>.&nbsp; The teeth of the comb are represented by what
are practically seeds.&nbsp; These are elongated stick-like
objects covered with minute prickles all pointing upwards.&nbsp;
I do not know how the seeds germinate under ordinary conditions,
but I learn from Mr Shrubbs that they are dragged into the holes
of earthworms, as my father describes in the case of sticks and
leaf-stalks.&nbsp; Unfortunately for the worms, the prickles on
Venus&rsquo; needles do not allow the creatures to free
themselves, and they actually die in considerable numbers with
the needles fixed in their gullets.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Few, if indeed any, have ever known plants

<p style="text-align: right">&mdash;<span

</blockquote>
<p>Joseph Dalton Hooker was born in 1817 and died in 1911; and of
these ninety-four years eighty-one included botanical work, for
at thirteen &ldquo;Joseph&rdquo; was &ldquo;becoming a zealous
botanist&rdquo;; and Mr L. Huxley records (ii., 480) that he kept
at work till a little before his death on 10th December 1911, and
that although his physical strength began to fail in August, yet
&ldquo;till the end he was keenly interested in current topics
and the latest contribution to natural science.&rdquo;&nbsp; So
far as actual research is concerned, it is remarkable that he
should have continued to work at the Balsams&mdash;a very
difficult class of plants&mdash;at least till 1910.&nbsp; Mr
Huxley has wisely determined to make his book of a reasonable
size, and the task of compressing his gigantic mass of material
into two volumes must have been a difficult one.&nbsp; He has
been thoroughly successful, <a name="citation115b"></a><a
href="#footnote115b" class="citation">[115b]</a> and no aspect of
Sir <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>Joseph&rsquo;s life is neglected,
the whole being admirably arranged and annotated, and treated
throughout with conspicuous judgment and skill.</p>
<p>In an &ldquo;autobiographical fragment&rdquo; (i., p. 3) Sir
Joseph records that he was born at Halesworth in Suffolk,
&ldquo;being the second child of William Jackson Hooker and Maria
Turner.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was not only the son of an eminent
botanist, but fate went so far as to give him a botanical
godfather in the person of Rev. J. Dalton, &ldquo;a student of
carices and mosses and discoverer of <i>Scheuchzeria</i> in
England.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was after Mr Dalton that Hooker was
named, his first name, Joseph, commemorating his grandfather
Hooker.&nbsp; In 1821 the family moved to Glasgow, where Sir
William Hooker was appointed Professor of Botany.&nbsp; It was
here that Sir Joseph, at the age of five or six, showed his
innate love of plants, for he records <a
name="citation116"></a><a href="#footnote116"
class="citation">[116]</a>:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was still in petticoats, I was found grubbing in
a wall in the dirty suburbs of the dirty city of Glasgow, and . .
. when asked what I was about, I cried out that I had found
<i>Bryum argenteum</i> (which it was not), a very pretty little
moss which I had seen in my father&rsquo;s collection, and to
which I had taken a great fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While still a child his father used to take him on excursions
in the Highlands, and on one occasion, on returning home, Joseph
built up a heap of stones to represent a mountain and
&ldquo;stuck upon it specimens of the mosses I had collected on
it, at heights relative to those at which I had gathered
them.&nbsp; This was the dawn of my love for geographical
botany.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>Sir Joseph records that his father gave him a scrap of
a moss gathered by Mungo Park when almost at the point of
death.&nbsp; It excited in him a desire of entering Africa by
Morocco, and crossing the greater Atlas.&nbsp; That childish
dream, he says, &ldquo;I never lost; I nursed it till, half a
century afterwards, . . . I did (with my friend Mr Ball, who is
here by me, and another friend Mr G. Maw) ascend to the summit of
the previously unconquered Atlas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1820 William Hooker was appointed to the newly founded
Professorship of Botany at Glasgow.&nbsp; Of this his son Joseph
writes, &ldquo;It was a bold venture for my father to undertake
so responsible an office, for he had never lectured, or even
attended a course of lectures.&rdquo;&nbsp; With wonderful energy
he &ldquo;published in time for use in his second course, the
<i>Flora Scotica</i> in two volumes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir
Joseph&rsquo;s mother was Maria, daughter of Dawson Turner,
banker, botanist and arch&aelig;ologist, so that science was
provided on both sides of the pedigree.</p>
<p>It would seem that Sir Joseph&rsquo;s mother was somewhat of a
martinet.&nbsp; When Joseph came in from school he had to present
himself to her, and &ldquo;was not allowed to sit down in her
presence without permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1832, Joseph, then fifteen years of age, entered Glasgow
University, being already, in the words of his father, &ldquo;a
fair British botanist&rdquo; with &ldquo;a tolerable herbarium
very much of his own collecting&rdquo;; he adds, &ldquo;Had he
time for it, he would already be more useful to me than Mr
Klotzsch&rdquo; [his assistant].</p>
<p>It was in 1838 that Hooker got his opportunity, <!-- page
118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>for it chanced that James Clerk Ross, the Arctic
explorer, was in 1838 visiting at the Smiths of Jordan
Hill.&nbsp; In order that Joseph might meet Ross, both he and his
father were invited to breakfast.&nbsp; The meeting ended in Ross
promising to take him as surgeon and naturalist.&nbsp; There
seems to have been a little innocent jobbery with folks in high
places, and it fortunately turned out that the expedition was
delayed so that Joseph had the opportunity of spending some time
at Haslar Hospital.</p>
<p>The expedition seems to have been fitted out with astonishing
poverty.&nbsp; Seventy years later he wrote, &ldquo;Except some
drying paper for plants, I had not a single instrument or book
supplied to me as a naturalist&mdash;all were given to me by my
father.&nbsp; I had, however, the use of Ross&rsquo;s library,
and you may hardly credit it, but it is fact that not a single
glass bottle was supplied for collecting purposes; empty pickle
bottles were all we had, and rum as a preservative from the
ship&rsquo;s stores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is interesting to find Ross, in his preliminary talk with
Hooker, saying that he wanted a trained naturalist, &ldquo;such a
person as Mr Darwin&rdquo;&mdash;to which Hooker aptly retorted
by asking what Mr Darwin was before he went out.</p>
<p>I imagine that Hooker was lucky in being taken on Ross&rsquo;s
voyage <i>as a naturalist</i>, since the primary object of the
expedition was to fill up &ldquo;the wide blanks in the knowledge
of terrestrial magnetism in the southern hemisphere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems like a forecast of what was to be the chief
friendship of his life, that Darwin&rsquo;s <!-- page 119--><a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span><i>Naturalist&rsquo;s Voyage</i> should have been one
of the books that inspired him to join in the voyage of the
<i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i>.&nbsp; Hooker &ldquo;slept with
the proofs under his pillow, and devoured them eagerly the moment
he woke in the morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; Much earlier he had been
stirred by Cook&rsquo;s voyages, and, like Darwin, was fired by
Humboldt&rsquo;s <i>Personal Narrative</i>.&nbsp; While at sea
his work was largely zoological, and the tow-net was kept
busy.&nbsp; But on 24th August 1841, he writes to his father of
his great wish to devote himself &ldquo;to collecting plants and
studying them . . . but we are comparatively seldom off the sea,
and then in the most unpropitious seasons for travelling or
collecting.&rdquo;&nbsp; He speaks, too, of his wish to see the
end of the voyage, in order that he might devote himself to
botany.</p>
<p>The voyage had its dangers: in March 1842, during a storm, the
<i>Terror</i> collided with the <i>Erebus</i>, and for nearly ten
minutes the interlocked ships drifted towards a huge berg: the
<i>Erebus</i> remained rolling and striking her masts against the
berg, but managed by the &ldquo;desperate expedient&rdquo; of
&ldquo;sailing stern first down wind&rdquo; to escape
destruction.</p>
<p>Hooker writes to his father, 25th November 1842: &ldquo;The
Barrier, the bergs several hundred feet high and 1&ndash;6 miles
long, and the Mts. of the great Antarctic continent, are too
grand to be imagined, and almost too stupendous to be carried in
the memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a letter to his mother he describes seeing at Cape Horn
&ldquo;a little cairn of stones raised by the officers of the
<i>Beagle</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again he writes, &ldquo;Clouds
<!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>and fogs, rain and snow justified all Darwin&rsquo;s
accurate descriptions of a dreary Fuegian summer.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
speaks of Darwin&rsquo;s <i>Naturalist&rsquo;s Voyage</i> as
&ldquo;not only indispensable but a delightful companion and
guide.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is plenty of interesting matter in the
account of Hooker&rsquo;s voyage, but the above fragments of
detail must here suffice.&nbsp; The <i>Erebus</i> and
<i>Terror</i> reached Woolwich on 7th September 1843.</p>
<p>Having safely returned to England, the next problem was what
was to be Hooker&rsquo;s permanent occupation.&nbsp; Nothing,
however, was fixed on, and in the meantime he fulfilled
&ldquo;his intention of seeing the chief Continental botanists,
and comparing their gardens and collections with those of
Kew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His first visit was to Humboldt, at Paris, who turned out
&ldquo;a punchy little German,&rdquo; whereas he had expected
&ldquo;a fine fellow 6 feet without his boots.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of
the great man he says, &ldquo;He certainly is still a most
wonderful man, with a sagacity and memory and capability for
generalising that are quite marvellous.&nbsp; I gave him my book
[<i>Flora Antarctica</i>], which delighted him much; he read
through the first three numbers, and I suppose noted down thirty
or forty things which he asked me particulars about.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Humboldt was then seventy-six years of age.&nbsp; Hooker&rsquo;s
impression of the Paris botanists was not favourable; he speaks
of their habit of telling him of the magnitude of their own
researches, &ldquo;while of those of their neighbours they seem
to know very little indeed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of Decaisne, however, he
speaks with warm appreciation.&nbsp; He would have been surprised
if a prophet <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>had told him that he was to be
instrumental in bringing out an English version of
Decaisne&rsquo;s well-known book.</p>
<p>In 1845 Hooker acted as a deputy for Graham, the Professor of
Botany at Edinburgh.&nbsp; In May he wrote to his father,
&ldquo;I am lecturing away like a house on fire.&nbsp; I was not
in the funk I expected, though I had every reason to be in a far
greater one.&rdquo;&nbsp; Finally, when Graham died, Balfour, the
father of the present holder of the office, was elected
professor, and Hooker was fortunately freed from a post that
would have been a fatal tie to his career.</p>
<p>But happier events followed; he became engaged to Frances,
daughter of Professor Henslow.&nbsp; Sir William spoke of the
affair with a certain pomposity: &ldquo;I believe Miss Henslow to
be an amiable and well-educated person of most respectable though
not high connections, and from all that I have seen of her, well
suited to Joseph&rsquo;s habits and pursuits.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their
engagement was a long one, and their marriage could not take
place till after his Indian journey, which was the next event of
importance in his career.</p>
<p>On the voyage out, he was fortunate in becoming known to Lord
Dalhousie, and the friendship built up in the course of the
journey and afterwards in India &ldquo;showed itself in unstinted
support of Hooker.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was, however, &ldquo;a
personal appreciation of the man rather than of the scientific
investigator.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed, Lord Dalhousie, &ldquo;a
perfect specimen of the miserable system of education pursued at
Oxford,&rdquo; had a &ldquo;lamentably low opinion&rdquo; of
science.</p>
<p>At Darjiling began Hooker&rsquo;s &ldquo;lifelong friendship
<!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>with a very remarkable character, Brian Hodgson,&rdquo;
<a name="citation122a"></a><a href="#footnote122a"
class="citation">[122a]</a> administrator and scholar, who had
&ldquo;won equal fame as Resident at the court of Nepal and as a
student of Oriental lore.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr L. Huxley points out
that &ldquo;if the friendship with Lord Dalhousie provided the
key that opened official barriers and made Hooker&rsquo;s
journeyings possible, the friendship with Hodgson more than
anything else made them a practical success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shall not attempt to follow Hooker through his
wanderings&mdash;only a few scattered references to them are
possible.&nbsp; It is pleasant to read that when Mr Elwes visited
Sikkim twenty-two years after Hooker, he found that the Lepchas
almost worshipped him, and he was remembered as a learned Hakim,
an incarnation of wisdom and strength.</p>
<p>The most exciting adventure of Hooker and his fellow-traveller
was their imprisonment in Sikkim, where their lives were clearly
in danger, and they were only released when &ldquo;troops were
hurried up to Darjiling&rdquo; and &ldquo;an ultimatum dispatched
to the Rajah.&rdquo; <a name="citation122b"></a><a
href="#footnote122b" class="citation">[122b]</a></p>
<p>For the rest of his botanical journeyings he had the
companionship of Thomson, who had been his fellow-student, and,
like himself, was the son of a Glasgow professor.&nbsp; A letter
to his father (undated) gives an idea of the wonderful success of
his Indian travels: &ldquo;It is easy to talk of a <i>Flora
Indica</i>, and Thomson and I do talk of it, to imbecility!&nbsp;
But <!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>suppose that we even adopted the
size, quality of paper, brevity of description, etc., which
characterise De Candolle&rsquo;s <i>Prodromus</i>, and we should,
even under these conditions, fill twelve such volumes at
least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The usual shabbiness <a name="citation123"></a><a
href="#footnote123" class="citation">[123]</a> of governments
towards science is well illustrated (p. 344) in the case of
Hooker:&mdash;&ldquo;His total expenditure was &pound;2200; the
official allowances were &pound;1200: the remainder was
contributed from his own and his father&rsquo;s purse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1855 Joseph began his official life at Kew on being
appointed assistant to his father.&nbsp; And ten years later, on
Sir William&rsquo;s death, he succeeded as a matter of course to
the Directorship.</p>
<p>Shortly before this, <i>i.e.</i> in 1854, he was the recipient
of an honour greatly coveted by men of science, namely the award
of the Royal Medal.&nbsp; He is characteristically pleased for
the sake of the science of Botany rather than for himself, and
refers to the neglect that botany has generally experienced at
the hands of the Society in comparison with zoological
subjects.&nbsp; His own success <!-- page 124--><a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>characteristically reminds him of what he considered a
slight to his father, viz., that he had not received the Copley
Medal of the Royal Society.&nbsp; This, the highest honour which
men of science can aspire to, is open not merely to Britons but
to all the world, and I should doubt whether Sir William had ever
been high in the list of possible recipients.</p>
<p>We are now approaching the great change wrought in the
scientific outlook of the world by the <i>Origin of
Species</i>.&nbsp; In November 1856, after reading Darwin&rsquo;s
MS. on geographical distribution, Hooker wrote that though
&ldquo;never very stubborn about unalterability of specific type,
I never felt so shaky about species before.&rdquo;&nbsp; It must
be remembered that throughout the companionship of Hooker and
Darwin the latter was a convinced evolutionist.&nbsp; He writes
in his autobiography that in 1838, after reading Malthus on
Population, he was convinced of the origin of new species by
means of natural selection.&nbsp; Throughout the close
intercourse which subsisted for so many years between Hooker and
Darwin, in which the views afterwards put forth in the <i>Origin
of Species</i> were discussed, Hooker seems not to have been a
convinced evolutionist.&nbsp; His conversion dates apparently
from 1858, when the papers by Darwin and Wallace were read at the
Linnean Society.&nbsp; This has always appeared to me remarkable,
and T. H. Huxley <a name="citation124"></a><a href="#footnote124"
class="citation">[124]</a> has said with regard to his own
position:&mdash;&ldquo;My reflection, when I first made myself
master of the central idea of the <!-- page 125--><a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>&lsquo;Origin&rsquo; was, &lsquo;How extremely stupid
not to have thought of that!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the publication of the <i>Origin of Species</i> Hooker
wrote to Darwin, <a name="citation125"></a><a href="#footnote125"
class="citation">[125]</a> &ldquo;I have not yet got half through
the book, not from want of will, but of time&mdash;for it is the
very hardest book to read, to full profit, that I ever
tried&mdash;it is so cram-full of matter and reasoning. . .
.&nbsp; Somehow it reads very different from the MS., and I often
fancy that I must have been very stupid not to have more fully
followed it in MS.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever Hooker may have been he was not stupid, and though
nowadays it is easy to feel surprise that his long-continued
familiarity with Darwin&rsquo;s work had not earlier convinced
him of the doctrine of evolution by means of natural selection,
we must ascribe it rather to his early education in the
sacrosanct meaning of the word <i>species</i>.</p>
<p>I think it must have been roughly about the time of the
publication of the <i>Origin of Species</i> that my earliest
memories of Sir Joseph Hooker refer.&nbsp; I clearly remember his
eating gooseberries with us as children, in the kitchen garden at
Down.&nbsp; The love of gooseberries was a bond between us which
had no existence in the case of our uncles, who either ate no
gooseberries or preferred to do so in solitude.&nbsp; By a
process of evolutionary change the word gooseberry took on a new
meaning at Down.&nbsp; Hooker used to send Darwin some especially
fine bananas grown in the Kew hothouses, and these were called
Kew gooseberries.&nbsp; It was characteristic <!-- page 126--><a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>of my
father to feel doubts as to whether he ought to receive Royal
bananas from a Royal garden.&nbsp; I wish I could remember Hooker
romping with us as children, of which he somewhere speaks.</p>
<p>It was about this time that Darwin had a fancy to make out the
names of the English grasses, and Hooker wrote, &ldquo;How on
earth you have made out 30 grasses rightly is a mystery to
me.&nbsp; You must have a marvellous tact for appreciating
diagnosis.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was at this time that one of
Darwin&rsquo;s boys remarked in regard to a grass he had
found:&mdash;&ldquo;I are an extraordinary grass-finder, and must
have it particularly by me all dinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; Strange to
say he did not grow into a botanist.</p>
<p>Hooker&rsquo;s letters at this time impress me with the
difficulty he met with in adapting his systematic work to the
doctrines of evolution.&nbsp; He gives the impression of working
at species in a puzzled or discontented frame of mind.&nbsp; Thus
on 1st January 1859, he writes to a
fellow-botanist:&mdash;&ldquo;What I shall try to do is, to
harmonise the facts with the newest doctrines, not because they
are the truest, but because they do give you room to reason and
reflect at present, and hopes for the future, whereas the old
stick-in-the-mud doctrines of absolute creations, multiple
creations, and dispersion by actual causes under existing
circumstances, are all used up, they are so many stops to further
enquiry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few days later he continues to the same correspondent:
&ldquo;If the course of migration does not agree with that of
birds, winds, currents, etc., so much the worse for the facts of
migration!&rdquo;&nbsp; On <!-- page 127--><a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>the whole
it seems to me a remarkable fact that Hooker&rsquo;s conversion
to evolution was such a slow affair.&nbsp; As Mr Huxley points
out, &ldquo;The partial light thrown on the question in
fragmentary discussions was not enough, and until 1858&ndash;59,
after the consolidation of Darwin&rsquo;s arguments in the famous
Abstract [<i>The Origin of Species</i>], Hooker . . . worked
avowedly on the accepted lines of the fixity of species, for
which he had so far found no convincing substitute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is pleasant to read Darwin&rsquo;s warm-hearted words: <a
name="citation127a"></a><a href="#footnote127a"
class="citation">[127a]</a> &ldquo;You may say what you like, but
you will never convince me that I do not owe you ten times as
much as you can owe me&rdquo; (30th Dec. 1858).</p>
<p>Hooker&rsquo;s importance in the world was ever on the
increase, and this had also its usual concomitant
drawbacks.&nbsp; Huxley wrote to him <a
name="citation127b"></a><a href="#footnote127b"
class="citation">[127b]</a> on 19th December 1860: &ldquo;It is
no use having any false modesty about the matter.&nbsp; You and
I, if we last ten years longer&mdash;and you by a long while
first&mdash;will be representatives of our respective lines in
the country.&nbsp; In that capacity we shall have certain duties
to perform, to ourselves, to the outside world, and to
Science.&nbsp; We shall have to swallow praise, which is no great
pleasure, and to stand multitudinous bastings and
irritations.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this was doubtless a true prophecy
for both the friends.</p>
<p>Hooker&rsquo;s work&mdash;both his botanical research and
duties of a more public character&mdash;was ever on the
increase.</p>
<p>In the first category comes the <i>Genera Plantarum</i>, a
gigantic piece of work begun with the co-operation <!-- page
128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>of
Bentham in the &rsquo;60&rsquo;s, and continued until 1883.&nbsp;
The aim of this celebrated publication was no less than to give a
revised definition of every genus of flowering plants.&nbsp; If
this had been the only publication by the two friends, it had
been enough to found a high and permanent place in the botanical
world.&nbsp; But as far as Hooker was concerned, it may almost be
said to have been carried out in his spare moments.&nbsp; It
should be remembered that for part of this period he was aided in
the management of the Gardens by Sir William Thiselton-Dyer, who
began as Hooker&rsquo;s Private Secretary and was then made
Assistant Director. <a name="citation128a"></a><a
href="#footnote128a" class="citation">[128a]</a></p>
<p>The Presidency of the Royal Society, which Hooker held
1873&ndash;78, was clearly a great strain, but he carried out the
work (which is in fact that of a ministry of science) with
conspicuous success.</p>
<p>In January 1873 he wrote to Darwin:&mdash;&ldquo;I quite agree
as to the awful honour of P. R. S. . . . but, my dear fellow, I
don&rsquo;t want to be crowned head of science.&nbsp; I dread
it&mdash;&lsquo;Uneasy is the head, etc.&rsquo;&mdash;and my
beloved Gen. Plant. will be grievously impeded.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
gives some idea of the strain of his work as a whole when we find
him writing <a name="citation128b"></a><a href="#footnote128b"
class="citation">[128b]</a> to Darwin (Jan. 14, 1875): &ldquo;I
have 15 Committees of the R[oyal] S[ociety] to attend to.&nbsp; I
cannot tell you what a relief they are to me&mdash;matters are so
ably and quietly conducted by Stokes, Huxley, and Spottiswoode
that to me they are of the same sort of relaxation that
metaphysics are to Huxley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He speaks, <a name="citation128c"></a><a href="#footnote128c"
class="citation">[128c]</a> too (1874), of the annual
conversazione <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>as &ldquo;a tremendous affair. . .
.&nbsp; How I did pity the President of the United
States.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am reminded of an American caricature of
the President of the United States with red, swollen fingers,
inscribed:&mdash;&ldquo;The hand we have shaken so
often.&rdquo;&nbsp; With regard to other honours, he declined at
once the K.C.M.G.; he then began to dread a K.C.B.; finally he
was trapped into the K.C.S.I., an honour which most men would
desire quite as much as Hooker longed to decline it.</p>
<p>In 1873 Hooker made a series of experiments on the digestion
and absorption of food by certain insectivorous plants, notably
Nepenthes, with the object of helping Darwin in his work on that
subject.</p>
<p>We must return a year or two to deal with a matter which, as
Mr L. Huxley remarks, &ldquo;ravaged and embittered&rdquo; the
period 1870&ndash;72&mdash;namely, his conflict with Ayrton, the
First Commissioner of Works in Gladstone&rsquo;s
Government.&nbsp; Mr L. Huxley, like a clever musician, gives a
touch of Ayrton&rsquo;s tone in the opening phrases of his
composition.&nbsp; At a grand festivity in honour of the Shah of
Persia this sovereign was unaccountably anxious to meet the
Commissioner of Works.&nbsp; Ayrton was at supper, and bluntly
responded, with his mouth full of chicken, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see
the old nigger in Jericho first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began to show his quality by sending an &ldquo;official
reprimand to the Director of Kew.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, the first
received in twenty-nine years&rsquo; service, was based &ldquo;on
a misapprehension.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ayrton&rsquo;s aim seems to have
been to compel Hooker to resign and convert Kew Gardens into a
public park.</p>
<p><!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>In 1871 Hooker casually discovered from a subordinate
&ldquo;that he himself had been superseded . . . in one of his
most important duties&mdash;namely, the heating of the
plant-houses.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would take too long to enumerate
the endless acts of insolence and folly which marked
Ayrton&rsquo;s treatment of Hooker.&nbsp; A full statement of the
case was drawn up and signed by a small body of the most
distinguished scientific men of the day, and after a debate in
the House of Commons, Mr Ayrton was kicked upstairs &ldquo;from
the Board of Works to the resuscitated office of Judge Advocate
General.&rdquo;&nbsp; I remember an anecdote which illustrates
Ayrton&rsquo;s stupendous ignorance of the great department over
which he was called to rule.&nbsp; Hooker was taking Ayrton round
the Gardens when they met Mr Bentham, who happened to remark that
he had come from the Herbarium.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said
Ayrton, &ldquo;did you get your feet wet?&rdquo;&nbsp; For the
official ruler of Kew there was no difference between a Herbarium
and an Aquarium.</p>
<p>This period has pleasanter memories, for it was in 1873 that
Huxley, much out of health and &ldquo;heavily mulcted&rdquo; by
having to pay the costs of an unsuccessful action brought against
him by a man of straw, was persuaded to accept from a group of
personal friends a sum of &pound;3000 to clear his financial
position, Hooker wrote to Darwin, &ldquo;I am charmed by
Huxley&rsquo;s noble-minded letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1874 Mrs Hooker died, leaving six children, of whom three
still required care.&nbsp; Hooker wrote later to Darwin from
Nuneham (ii., p. 191): &ldquo;I am here on two days&rsquo; visit
to a place I had not seen <!-- page 131--><a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>since I was
here with Fanny Henslow [Mrs Hooker] in 1847.&nbsp; I cannot tell
you how depressed I feel at times.&nbsp; She, you, and Oxford are
burnt into my memory.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here occurs, in a letter from
Mrs Bewicke, some account of Hooker&rsquo;s method of dealing
with his family.&nbsp; She gives the impression (though clearly
not intentionally) that Hooker rather worried his children.&nbsp;
She speaks of the many questions he asked them at meals and the
pleasure he took in their success in answering.&nbsp; She adds,
&ldquo;When we drove into London with him, he would tell us the
names of the big houses and their owners, and then expect us to
know them as we drove back.&rdquo;&nbsp; This confirms my
impression that Hooker was not quite judicious in his manner of
educating or enlightening his children.&nbsp; I have a general
impression of having sympathised with them in their
difficulties.</p>
<p>In 1876, Hooker was happily married to Hyacinth, widow of Sir
William Jardine; and about the same time Sir William
Thiselton-Dyer married Sir Joseph&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>The <i>Index Kewensis</i>, which unites the names of two
friends, was carried out at Kew, with funds supplied by
Darwin.&nbsp; It was in fact a completion of Steudel&rsquo;s
<i>Nomenclator</i>, and was published in four quarto volumes in
1892&ndash;95.&nbsp; The MS. is said to have weighed more than a
ton and comprised about 375,000 entries.&nbsp; Hooker, with
wonderful energy and devotion, read and criticised it in detail.
<a name="citation131"></a><a href="#footnote131"
class="citation">[131]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>In 1885, Hooker resigned his position as Director at
Kew, and henceforward lived at the Camp, Sunningdale, his
&ldquo;Tusculum&rdquo; among the pine-woods as Mr Huxley puts it,
where he remained, ever hard at work, for twenty-six years.</p>
<p>He was still astonishingly vigorous; at eighty-two he was
&ldquo;younger than ever,&rdquo; though at ninety-three he
confessed to being lazy in his old age.</p>
<p>In 1885 and subsequent years he was, as I gratefully remember,
employed in helping me in the <i>Life and Letters of Charles
Darwin</i>.&nbsp; I could not have had a kinder or wiser
collaborator.</p>
<p>Hooker&rsquo;s unaffected modesty came out again about this
period.&nbsp; In 1887 he was awarded the Copley Medal of the
Royal Society, an honour which is the pinnacle of scientific
ambition, and is open to foreigners as well as British
subjects.&nbsp; He wrote in regard to the award, &ldquo;I never
once thought of myself as within the pale of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
in a letter to W. E. Darwin, &ldquo;The success of my
after-dinner homily at the R. S. is to me far more wonderful than
getting the Copley.&nbsp; You . . . can guess my condition of two
days&rsquo; nausea before the dinner, and 2 days of illness after
it.&nbsp; I am not speaking figuratively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We find Hooker here and there slashing at contemporary methods
of education.&nbsp; For instance, in regard to the mass of public
school boys: &ldquo;Not one of them can now translate a simple
paper in <!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>Latin or Greek, or will look into a
classical author, or listen to the talk about one.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mathematicians fared no better.&nbsp; He wrote in
1893:&mdash;&ldquo;What you say of A, B, and C does not surprise
me.&nbsp; They are <i>ne plus ultra</i> mathematicians, and have
not a conception of biological science, and in fact are only
<i>half-intellects</i> (I suppose I deserve to be
burned).&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is pleasant to find that Hooker allowed himself time to
indulge his love of art.&nbsp; He was especially fond of old
Wedgwood ware, and corresponded with William Darwin&mdash;a
fellow amateur.&nbsp; In 1895, he allowed the same friend to
become the owner of some old Wedgwood ware; and when the sale was
completed Hooker speaks of its being a relief &ldquo;to feel that
the crockery is going back where it should have gone by
rights.&rdquo; <a name="citation133"></a><a href="#footnote133"
class="citation">[133]</a>&nbsp; Elsewhere (ii., p. 360) Hooker
discourses pleasantly on the perfect adaption to its end of the
old Wedgwood ware.&nbsp; An old teapot, for instance, avoids all
the faults of the modern article, in lifting which &ldquo;you
scald your knuckles against the body of the pot&rdquo;; then the
lid shoots off and you scald your other hand in trying to save
it; the tea shoots out and splashes over the teacup; lastly the
&ldquo;spout dribbles when you set the pot down.&rdquo;&nbsp; All
these sins are provided against in the old Wedgwood teapot.</p>
<p>The <i>Flora of British India</i> having been finished, he was
asked to complete the handbook to the Flora of Ceylon,
interrupted by the death of Trimen, and this occupied him for
three years.&nbsp; He was then led to what was to be his final
piece of work, namely, a <!-- page 134--><a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>study of
the difficult group of the Balsams (<i>Impatiens</i>), and he
certainly was not coloured by what he worked in, for the whole
stock of his admirable patience was needed for this difficult
research.&nbsp; His perseverance was a by-product of his noble
enthusiasm.&nbsp; In 1906, when he was eighty-nine years of age,
he writes enthusiastically to a friend in the East expressing his
longing for more Balsams, and concluding, &ldquo;I do love Indian
Botany.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in 1909 he hears that the Paris
Herbarium had overlooked forty sheets of Indo-Chinese
specimens&mdash;and writes, &ldquo;This is like a stroke of
paralysis to a man approaching his ninety-third year, but it is
no use grumbling, my eyes are as good as ever, and my fingers are
as agile as ever, and I am indeed thankful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Life</i> of Hooker is enriched by a striking essay from
the pen of Professor Bower.&nbsp; He points out (ii., p. 412)
that &ldquo;few, if indeed any, have ever known plants as he
did.&nbsp; Such knowledge comes only from growing up with them
from earliest childhood.&rdquo;&nbsp; Professor Bower adds that
Hooker &ldquo;shared with Darwin that wider outlook upon the
field of Science that gave a special value to the writings of
both&rdquo;; and he adds, &ldquo;The <i>Himalayan Journals</i>
ranks with Darwin&rsquo;s <i>Voyage of the</i>
&lsquo;<i>Beagle</i>&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When <i>More Letters of Charles Darwin</i> was in preparation,
Hooker was appealed to for assistance, and wrote a
characteristically kind letter (1st Feb. 1899) to one of the
editors:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will gladly help you all I can; so have no scruples.
. . .&nbsp; You are right to make the book uncompromisingly
scientific.&nbsp; It will be greatly valued.&nbsp; <!-- page
135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>I
am getting so old and oblivious that I fear I may not be of much
use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And a few weeks later (24th Feb. 1899):&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no idea that your father had kept my
letters.&nbsp; Your account of 742 pp. of them is a
revelation.&nbsp; I do enjoy re-reading your father&rsquo;s; as
to my own, I regard it as a punishment for my various sins of
blindness, perversity, and inattention to his thousand and one
facts and hints that I did not profit by as much as I should
have, all as revealed by my letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1907 he received the Order of Merit, the Insignia being
conveyed to him by Colonel Douglas Dawson from the King.&nbsp; I
had the honour of being the only person present on the occasion,
though why Sir Joseph allowed me this pleasure I cannot
guess.&nbsp; I remember Colonel Dawson in vain trying to persuade
Sir Joseph not to see him to his carriage at the door.&nbsp; I
have, too, a picture of Sir Joseph fidgeting round the room
afterwards, unwillingly wearing the collar to please his
family.</p>
<p>In 1908 he took the chief part in the fiftieth anniversary of
the Darwin-Wallace papers of 1858.&nbsp; He characteristically
begged the Darwins to tell him if they entertained &ldquo;the
<i>smallest</i> doubt of the expediency or propriety of telling
the public the part&rdquo; which he took on that historic
occasion!</p>
<p>He was also the chief guest at the 1909 celebration at
Cambridge of the centenary of Darwin&rsquo;s birth.&nbsp; I
recollect him wandering about at the evening reception, quite
unconsciously the object of all eyes.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Hooker
was not present <!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>at the banquet, where, as Mr L.
Huxley says, &ldquo;Mr Balfour&rsquo;s historic speech was only
eclipsed by the sense of personal charm in Mr W. E.
Darwin&rsquo;s reminiscences of his father&rdquo; (ii., p.
467).</p>
<p>It is delightful to find Hooker in 1911 vigorously
corresponding with Dr Bruce, a &ldquo;brother
Antarctic.&rdquo;&nbsp; He writes to Bruce, 20th February 1911,
&ldquo;I return herewith the proof-sheets, which I have perused
with extraordinary interest and an amount of instruction and
information that I never expected to receive at my age&rdquo;
(<i>Life</i>, ii., p. 478).&nbsp; It is touching that in extreme
old age the first work that occupied his youth should still find
so clear an echo in his vigorous old age.</p>
<p>Mr Huxley records (ii., p. 480) that though Sir Joseph
&ldquo;kept at work till but a little before the end,&rdquo; his
physical strength began to fail in the late summer; but his
mental powers were undimmed.&nbsp; He died in his sleep on 10th
December 1911, and was buried (as he had desired) near his
father&rsquo;s grave at Kew.</p>
<h2><!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>A GREAT HOSPITAL <a
name="citation137a"></a><a href="#footnote137a"
class="citation">[137a]</a></h2>
<p>Dr Moore writes in his preface: &ldquo;The History is a gift
from me to St Bartholomew&rsquo;s, and I hope that the labour of
investigating historical events, of meditating upon them, and of
finally writing the book in such hours as my profession allowed
during more than thirty years, may be taken as a proof of the
gratitude I feel to the noble hospital with which my whole
professional life has been connected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The book seems to me eminently worthy of its subject and of
its learned author. <a name="citation137b"></a><a
href="#footnote137b" class="citation">[137b]</a>&nbsp; As a
record of the 800 years during which the Hospital has existed it
naturally contains an enormous mass of detail, and this means
that the book is physically very big.&nbsp; The first volume is
of 614 quarto pages, and the second of 992 pages.&nbsp; The index
contains at least 20,000 entries.</p>
<p>The Hospital and the Priory of St Bartholomew were the first
buildings erected on the open space of Smithfield.&nbsp; The
foundation took place in 1123, and Rahere, the founder, was the
first Prior.&nbsp; He is <!-- page 138--><a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>said to
have been of lowly race, and to have made himself popular in the
houses of nobles and princes &ldquo;by witcisms and flattering
talk.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he repented of such a mode of life and
made a pilgrimage to Rome to obtain forgiveness.&nbsp; On his way
back he had a vision of St Bartholomew, by whom he was directed
to found a church in Smithfield.</p>
<p>It seems that &ldquo;no part of the hospital as built by
Rahere is now standing, but within the present building, which
covers the original site, there still remains one thing which was
there in his time.&nbsp; It is a legal document which his eyes
beheld, and which was sealed in his presence.&nbsp; This charter
is written on vellum in the clear hand-writing of the first half
of the twelfth century.&rdquo;&nbsp; The seal shows a
&ldquo;turreted building, which is probably the Priory of St
Bartholomew&rsquo;s as it looked in the first twenty years of its
existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two parts of an indented chirograph have been preserved in
the hospital, which give (i., p. 239) a view of the state of
agriculture in Essex in the reign of King John.&nbsp; Mention is
made of fields of wheat, rye, barley, oats and beans; of oxen,
horses, of brew-house and barn.&nbsp; Rent was paid in kind and
sent by water to the hospital quay, which may have been on the
River Fleet and therefore nearer to the hospital than a
landing-place on the Thames.&nbsp; The Fleet river, as Dr Moore
happily points out (i., p. 246), is now shut up in a tubular
dungeon, &ldquo;as if to remind it of all the unhappiness it had
passed by in the Gaola de Flete from the time&rdquo; when the
prisoners watched &ldquo;the ships passing up <!-- page 139--><a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>it with
corn for St Bartholomew&rsquo;s Hospital . . . to the days when
the body of Samuel Pickwick was confided to the custody of the
tipstaff, to be by him taken to the Warden of the Fleet Prison,
and there detained until the amount of the damages and costs in
the action of Bardell against Pickwick was fully paid and
satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The author never fails to make interesting use of the driest
of charters.&nbsp; Thus in the reign of King John a person with
the pleasant name of Adam Pepercorn grants to the hospital ten
shillings quit-rent for some land in Grub Street, a region full
of unhappy memories.&nbsp; Dr Moore quotes passages from Johnson,
Swift, and Goldsmith to show that the name Grub Street should
have been protected by such associations from any change; but
nothing is sacred, and Grub Street is now known as Milton
Street.</p>
<p>The author (i., p. 279) asks whether the brethren of St
Bartholomew&rsquo;s made any medical studies, and points out they
may well have read parts of the <i>Liber Etymologiarum</i> by St
Isidore of Seville, who flourished <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 601.&nbsp; The book is a general
summary of knowledge in Isidore&rsquo;s day, and few religious
houses in England were without a copy.</p>
<p>I like the facts in the region of domestic economy which are
given.&nbsp; For instance, that in 1229 Richard of Muntfichet was
ordered by Henry III. to give &ldquo;six leafless oaks for the
hospital fire.&rdquo;&nbsp; We want to know whether they were the
King&rsquo;s oaks, or was Muntfichet forced to supply the
wood?&nbsp; If Dr R. W. Darwin (father of Charles Darwin) had
then <!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>been King of England he would have
ordered apple-trees, for these he considered much superior to all
other fuel.&nbsp; The reader is constantly meeting interesting
stories.&nbsp; Thus Bishop Roger Niger was, in the year 1230,
celebrating mass in St Paul&rsquo;s when a great thunderstorm
burst over the church and the congregation fled in terror.&nbsp;
But Roger and one deacon were not to be frightened, and went on
with the Mass.</p>
<p>In the 13th Century John of Marsham (i., p. 390) made oath
that he would carry through the affairs of Alan of Culing at the
Court of Rome.&nbsp; Did John die on his journey, or did he fail
in his suit?&nbsp; He never claimed the charter which he left at
the hospital, where it may still be seen.</p>
<p>A charter recording a grant by the Master of St
Bartholomew&rsquo;s to the Bishop of Bath is preserved in St
Paul&rsquo;s; Sir Norman Moore says (i., p. 392), &ldquo;It was
pleasant to find this original document in the charter room of
the cathedral, where mine was probably the first hand from St
Bartholomew&rsquo;s Hospital which had touched it since it
received the seal of William the master and the brethren, six
hundred and seventy years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cannot resist quoting (i., p. 412) one more of the many
touching and interesting episodes with which the history of St
Bartholomew&rsquo;s abounds:&mdash;</p>
<p>Cecilia, a widow, devoted herself to the altar of St Edmund
and received a wedding ring.&nbsp; When she was dying (1251), a
Dominican father, giving her the last sacrament, noticed the ring
and said, &ldquo;Take off that ring, lest she die so decked
out.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cecilia <!-- page 141--><a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>roused
herself and said she would offer the ring &ldquo;before the
judgement seat of God my betrothed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is interesting to find that surnames were beginning to be
established in the reign of Henry III.&nbsp; Thus a certain
Thomas Niger is described as the son of Walter Niger. <a
name="citation141"></a><a href="#footnote141"
class="citation">[141]</a></p>
<p>There are innumerable facts given in the history of St
Bartholomew which illustrate the permanence of the London
streets.&nbsp; Thus in a document of 1256 is mentioned a little
lane going towards the church of St Mary Staining Lane.&nbsp; The
little lane is easily found at this day leading from Wood Street
to a small churchyard, on a stone in the wall of which is cut
&ldquo;Before the dreadful fire of 1666, here stood the church of
St Mary Staining&rdquo; (i., p. 441).</p>
<p>A document quoted (i., p. 454) is of interest in regard to the
value of money in medi&aelig;val times; the following extract
shows what in the reign of Henry II. was considered a serious
sum.&nbsp; The hospital owed the butcher eleven pounds, and the
master and brethren agreed to pay it in eight years and a quarter
by a rent charge on a house.</p>
<p>The reader of Sir Norman Moore&rsquo;s book is continually
coming across unexpected facts.&nbsp; For instance, that St
James&rsquo; Palace is on the site of what, in the reign of Henry
III., was known as the Hospital of St James.</p>
<p>On 15th June 1253, St Bartholomew&rsquo;s Hospital obtained
from Henry III. two important charters, <!-- page 142--><a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>one
confirming them in their possessions, the other in their rights
and privileges.&nbsp; The gift was made, among other reasons, for
the soul &ldquo;of King Henry my grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The author succeeds in conveying to his readers the personal
interest which he evidently feels in the writers of the deeds of
which he makes such good use.&nbsp; Thus (i., p. 477) he quotes
Maelbrigte, who made a copy of the later Gospels at Armagh in the
time of Rahere, as writing &ldquo;at the foot of a very small
page of vellum in a minute and exquisite hand, &lsquo;If it was
my wish I could write the whole treatise like this,&rsquo; thus
handing down to succeeding ages a scribe&rsquo;s pride in his
art.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again in a charter copied into the hospital
cartulary the last witness is &ldquo;Master Simon, who wrote this
charter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The author (i., p. 485) has occasion to refer to a grant by
Stephen of Gosewelle of certain lands.&nbsp; And this reminds him
how he heard Dickens read the trial in <i>Pickwick</i>.&nbsp; He
says, in &ldquo;almost every part I can recall his emphasis and
the tone of his voice.&mdash;&lsquo;Mrs Bardell shrunk from the
world and courted the retirement and tranquillity of Goswell
Street.&rsquo; . . .&nbsp; Very few know that this thoroughfare
was the street of a hamlet, extra barram de
Aldredesgate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a charter probably belonging to the earlier half of the
reign of Henry III., a witness, Sabrichet, &ldquo;has a name
which survives in Sabrichetestead or Sabstead, the native
pronunciation of Sawbridgeworth.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the out-patient
room a patient said that he came from Sawbridgeworth.&nbsp; The
physician, <a name="citation142"></a><a href="#footnote142"
class="citation">[142]</a> <!-- page 143--><a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>who had
been instructed by Henry Bradshaw, remarked that the patient did
not know how to pronounce the name of his own home.&nbsp; On this
the patient exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, I know it is Sabstead, but I
thought the gentleman would not understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Names have a fascination for me, and I cannot resist quoting
the name of Henry Pikebone, who, I hope, pronounced it Pickbone,
and might well have been one of Falstaff&rsquo;s men.&nbsp; We
meet (p. 510) with a reference to John of Yvingho, which is said
to have suggested Ivanhoe to Walter Scott.&nbsp; I regret to say
that John was a fishmonger.&nbsp; Elsewhere we meet another
pleasing name, Cecilia Pidekin, but unfortunately she is not
known in any other way than as the recipient, by a will of 1281,
of a chemise and a little brass pail.&nbsp; There are innumerable
points of interest in the matter of names.&nbsp; Thus the author
points out that Shoe Lane has nothing to do with shoes nor indeed
with lanes; it is a corruption of the <i>solanda</i> or prebend
through which it passes.</p>
<p>The author often helps us to realise the appearance of the
inhabitants of St Bartholomew&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Thus (p. 551) the
Bishop of London in his ordinance of 1316 settled that
&ldquo;those of the brethren who were priests were to wear round
cloaks of frieze or other cloth, the lay brethren shorter cloaks;
the sisters tunics and over-tunics of grey cloth, these not to be
longer than to their ankles.&rdquo;&nbsp; This last regulation is
curious.&nbsp; We should have expected the limitation to have
been applied to shortness rather than to length.</p>
<p><!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>Walter of Basingbourne <a name="citation144"></a><a
href="#footnote144" class="citation">[144]</a> was Master of the
Hospital during the greatest epidemic of plague which &ldquo;the
Western world had experienced since the time of
Justinian.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is generally known as the Black Death,
and was the same disease as that which terrified London in 1665,
and the epidemic which has destroyed nearly nine millions of
people in India since 1894.</p>
<p>Speaking (i., p. 584) of the Charter House, Sir Norman says:
&ldquo;Our hospital . . . saw the noble foundation of Thomas
Sutton built, and became familiar with its brethren in their
black cloaks and with the gown boys.&rdquo;&nbsp; He quotes
appositely enough Thackeray&rsquo;s well-known words on the death
of Colonel Newcome:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just as the last bell struck, a peculiar sweet
smile shone over his face, and he lifted up his head a little,
and quickly said &lsquo;Adsum,&rsquo; and fell back.&nbsp; It was
the word we used at school when names were called, and lo he,
whose heart was as that of a little child, had answered to his
name, and stood in the presence of his Master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1381 Wat Tyler and his mob sacked and burnt the Temple and
the Priory of Clerkenwell.&nbsp; A few days later the brethren
could see from their walls the blow struck by Walworth the Mayor,
the fall of Tyler from his horse, and the courageous behaviour of
King Richard.&nbsp; Wat Tyler was carried into the hospital, but
the Mayor went in and brought him out and had him beheaded.&nbsp;
Simon of Sudbury, Archbishop of Canterbury, was beheaded by the
rebels.&nbsp; <!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>Sir Norman Moore once asked a
patient whence she came, and she answered &ldquo;from Sudbury in
Suffolk.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr Moore told his students the story of
Simon&rsquo;s death, and added that his head is said to be
&ldquo;preserved to this day at Sudbury.&rdquo;&nbsp; The woman
raised herself in bed and said, &ldquo;My father keeps
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Simon&rsquo;s tomb at Canterbury has been
opened, and was found to contain a headless body.</p>
<p>During the mastership of William Wakering, who died in 1405,
and that of Sutton, John Mirfeld flourished in the priory of St
Bartholomew and wrote his <i>Breviarium Bartholomei</i>, which
may &ldquo;fairly be regarded as the first book on medicine
connected with St Bartholomew&rsquo;s Hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brethren had no watches, and had to measure &ldquo;the
time for heating fluids or making decoctions by reciting certain
psalms and prayers.&rdquo;&nbsp; I remember to have heard Sir
Norman say how he demonstrated to his pupils the efficacy of the
words which our ancestors prescribed for the cure of
epilepsy.&nbsp; Their magic depended on the fact that they
required some minutes to recite, and this allowed the patient to
recover from his fit.</p>
<p>I did not expect to find any evidence in regard to Falstaff,
but the following passage (ii., p. 2) shows that he must have
been damped (in two senses) on a memorable occasion <a
name="citation145"></a><a href="#footnote145"
class="citation">[145]</a>:&mdash;&ldquo;In the year 1413, on the
ninth day of the month of April, which day was Passion Sunday,
and a very rainy day, the coronation of Henry V. took place at
Westminster, at which coronation I, Brother John Cok, who have
recorded <!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>that royal coronation for the
refreshing of memory, was present and beheld it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Norman says (ii., p. 40):&mdash;&ldquo;I was present at
the coronation of King George V., and watched the splendid
assemblage gradually filling Westminster Abbey, . . . and heard
the shouts of &lsquo;God save King George!&rsquo; . . . and saw
the King in his crown, with the orb in his left hand and the
sceptre in his right, walk in solemn procession down the nave. .
. .&nbsp; It was a solemn as well as a splendid sight.&nbsp; More
than once during the day I thought of John Cok, the brother of St
Bartholomew&rsquo;s beholding five centuries ago within the same
walls and under the same noble vault, the coronation of the
future victor of Agincourt. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Cok is a valuable witness as regards the history of the
hospital, especially as to the mastership of John Wakeryng, who
held office for forty years.&nbsp; Cok became Rentar of the
Hospital, and the chief work of his life was the writing of the
Cartulary (which he called a Rental), recording rents due to the
hospital, deeds of gift, papal bulls, and other documents.&nbsp;
Cok&rsquo;s book (dated 1456) is a large volume written in Latin
on 636 leaves of vellum and enclosed in an ancient binding of oak
boards covered with leather.</p>
<p>In a transaction of 14th June 1423 is the first appearance of
the arms at present used by the hospital (ii., p. 16), namely,
party per pale argent and sable a chevron counter-changed.&nbsp;
It was probably Wakeryng&rsquo;s coat of arms, but ended by being
regarded as that of the hospital.&nbsp; The author <!-- page
147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>suggests that the chevron &ldquo;might symbolise the
hospital roof, while the equally divided and counter-changed
argent and sable suggested that each patient admitted had an even
chance of recovery or of death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1432 arrangements were made for a water-supply to the
hospital from Islington (Iseldon); and the &ldquo;waste of water
at the Cisterne&rdquo; was to be conveyed &ldquo;to the Gailes of
Newgate and Ludgate for the reliefe of the prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cock Lane, near the hospital, has, I fear, no connection with
brother John Cok (ii., p. 53); it was so called from the shops of
the cooks who prepared refreshments for the crowds who came to
Smithfield.&nbsp; It was at the end of Cock Lane that the fire of
London stopped in 1666, but it is better known as the scene of
the Cock Lane ghost.</p>
<p>Sir Richard Owen, who had been a student at St
Bartholomew&rsquo;s, told Dr Moore (ii., p. 54) a grim story of
Cock Lane.&nbsp; It was there that the hospital authorities hired
a house for the reception of the dead bodies of criminals hung at
Newgate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Owen was in a room on the first floor with
Sir William Blizard, the President, who was attired in court
dress as the proper costume for an official act.&nbsp; They heard
the shouts of the crowd and then the noise of an approaching
cart, which turned down Cock Lane and stopped at the door.&nbsp;
Then came the heavy steps of the executioner tramping up the
stairs.&nbsp; He had the body of a man who had been hanged on his
back, and entering the room, let it fall on a table. . . .&nbsp;
Sir William Blizard with a <!-- page 148--><a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>scalpel
made a small cut over the breast-bone, and bowed to the
executioner.&nbsp; This was, I suppose, the formal recognition of
the purpose for which the body had been delivered.&nbsp; The
rumbling of the cart, the contrast between the stiff figure of
Sir William Blizard in his court dress and the executioner in
coarse clothes, and the thud of each dead body on the table
remained in Owen&rsquo;s memory to the end of his days; and his
skill in telling the story has made me remember it nearly every
time that I have walked down Cock Lane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On 1st March 1711, a piece of literature destined &ldquo;to be
famous as long as English is read, was published near the end of
Duck Lane in Little Britain.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the first
number of the <i>Spectator</i>, and &ldquo;all London read it and
enjoyed it, from the motto to the end.&rdquo;&nbsp; The author
(ii., p. 63) imagines Mr Addison walking down Duck Lane the
Wednesday evening before its appearance, from Mr Buckley&rsquo;s
in Little Britain where he had corrected his last revise.</p>
<p>Sir Norman Moore adds: &ldquo;For me . . . Duke Street, Little
Britain, has innumerable memories of twenty-one happy
years.&nbsp; I lived there as a student and as house physician,
and then as Warden of the College of St
Bartholomew&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; He adds that his election as
Warden was his first professional success, which was followed by
a place on the permanent staff of the hospital.&nbsp; It was the
home of his early married life, and here his eldest child was
born.&nbsp; He need not have apologised (as he does); such
details will surely please all sympathetic readers.</p>
<p><!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>There is an interest in even the modern inhabitants of
Little Britain.&nbsp; We hear of dealers in gold lace and gold
leaf, and also a representative of that rare genus the
teapot-handle maker.&nbsp; These handles could not be worked on a
lathe, and had to be sawn out of the ivory.&nbsp; Dr Moore
learned that in all London there was but one other teapot-handle
maker: he felt what a favour it was when the great man mended a
fan for Mrs Moore.</p>
<p>It is pleasant to meet with the well-known lines from
Wordsworth&rsquo;s poem of &ldquo;Poor Susan&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Bright volumes of vapour through Lothbury
glide,<br />
And a river flows on through the vale of Cheapside.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I regret to say that our author quotes only to criticise,
since he denies that the mists of Lothbury are visible in
Cheapside.</p>
<p>In 1535 the hospital estate was valued at &pound;305, 6s. 7d.
according to one authority, and at &pound;371, 13s. 2d. by
another.&nbsp; St Bartholomew&rsquo;s was then the third hospital
in London in order of wealth.&nbsp; Henry VII.&rsquo;s Hospital
in the Savoy and the New Hospital of Our Lady outside Bishopsgate
were richer (ii., p. 125).</p>
<p>The Act of Dissolution was passed in 1536, and the property of
the hospital was given into the King&rsquo;s hands in 1537.&nbsp;
Thus the &ldquo;old order, which had existed for more than four
hundred years, was at an end, and the hospital was in the eye of
the law vacant and altogether destitute of a master, and of all
fellows or brethren&rdquo; (ii., p. 126).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Augustinians, Benedictines, Carthusians, Gilbertines,
Franciscans, Dominicans, and more, all were <!-- page 150--><a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>banished
from their ancient homes. . . .&nbsp; St Bartholomew&rsquo;s
Hospital was one of the few places where the injured tree of
charity began to put forth new branches, and soon flourished
again&rdquo; (ii., p. 148).</p>
<p>The King, after five years&rsquo; delay, granted, on 23rd June
1544, <a name="citation150"></a><a href="#footnote150"
class="citation">[150]</a> letters patent reconstituting the
hospital for its original uses.&nbsp; William Turges, the
King&rsquo;s Chaplain, was the first Master, and &ldquo;the body
corporate was to be called &lsquo;The Master and Chaplains of the
Hospital of St Bartholomew in West Smithfield, near
London.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; The grant did little for the poor,
but it prevented the destruction of St Bartholomew&rsquo;s and
carried on its existence.</p>
<p>The figure of Henry VIII. is above the Smithfield Gate of the
hospital.&nbsp; A full-length portrait of him hangs at the end of
the Great Hall.&nbsp; He is also represented in a window of the
hall handing the letters patent to the Lord Mayor and
citizens.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; says the author, &ldquo;do we
commemorate this destroying King, who might have taken away all
the estate of St Bartholomew&rsquo;s, but only took a small
portion of it&rdquo; (ii., p. 161).</p>
<p>The constitution under which the hospital is ruled was
established in 1547, and confirmed, with an alteration in but one
important particular, in 1782.&nbsp; &ldquo;Most of the offices
created by the Deed of Covenant of December 1546, and the letters
patent of January 1547, exist at the present day.&nbsp; The
treasurer, the almoners, the physician, the surgeon, the rentar,
the steward, the matron and sisters, the porter bearing a figure
of St Bartholomew on his staff of office, and <!-- page 151--><a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>the beadles
with silver badges engraved with the hospital arms, are all parts
of the present life of the hospital&rdquo; (ii., p. 191).</p>
<p>Beside the grave benefactors of the hospital we hear of
serio-comic personages who remind us of the curious lunatics
recorded by de Morgan in his <i>Budget of Paradoxes</i>.&nbsp;
Thus in 1774 Mr W. Gardiner offered &pound;2000 to St
Bartholomew&rsquo;s &ldquo;as a sacrifice for God&rsquo;s having
put it in his power to overturn Sir Isaac Newton&rsquo;s
system&rdquo; (ii., p. 245).</p>
<p>From 1547 the treasurer was &ldquo;a very important officer,
but the president also took an active part in the affairs of the
hospital.&rdquo;&nbsp; But now the treasurer is the responsible
head of the administration.</p>
<p>In 1518 the College of Physicians was founded by Henry VIII.
(ii., p. 408) on the advice of Dr Thomas Linacre.&nbsp; Its
active existence began in his house in Knightrider Street.&nbsp;
The most pious and the most learned men of England were
Linacre&rsquo;s intimate friends, and the &ldquo;example of his
life, as felt in the College of Physicians, continues a living
force to this day&rdquo; (ii., p. 411).</p>
<p>Dr John Caius (ii., p. 412) was a devoted follower of Linacre;
he was born 1510, went to Cambridge in 1529, and in 1533 was
elected Fellow of Gonville Hall.&nbsp; In 1539 he went to Padua,
where Vesalius, the founder of modern anatomy, was
Professor.&nbsp; In 1547 Caius was admitted a Fellow of the
College of Physicians, and not long after he came to live within
St Bartholomew&rsquo;s Hospital.</p>
<p>Caius wrote on the sweating sickness in 1552, and his work was
printed near St Bartholomew&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thus <!-- page
152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>were the proofs of the first medical monograph in the
English tongue, and, indeed, the first book written by an English
physician . . . on a particular disease, corrected in St
Bartholomew&rsquo;s&rdquo; (ii., p. 418).</p>
<p>Caius was in 1555 elected President of the College of
Physicians, to which he presented their silver caduceus with four
serpents at its head, a book of statutes, and a seal.&nbsp; In
1557&ndash;69 he was engaged in the refoundation and building at
Cambridge of what was to be known as Gonville and Caius
College.&nbsp; On his death his viscera were buried in St
Bartholomew&rsquo;s the Less, while the rest of his body was
placed in an alabaster tomb in the chapel of his college with the
inscription: &ldquo;Fui Caius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We meet with many proofs of the consideration shown by the
authorities towards the patients.&nbsp; For instance (ii., p.
279):&mdash;</p>
<p>13<i>th March</i> 1568.&mdash;&ldquo;This day it is graunted
by the courte that Griffen Davye shall departe forthwith into his
countrye, and also that he shall have 20s. in his purse to bringe
him home in consideracion that he is lame and
impotent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again (ii., p. 293), &ldquo;30<i>th April</i>
1597.&mdash;Ordered that curtaynes be provided for certain beds
of the poor.&rdquo;&nbsp; The author adds that &ldquo;moveable
curtains hang over the beds to this day, and are of great use in
providing privacy when patients are washing and
dressing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We meet with some trifling records of great events.&nbsp; Thus
on 7th May 1660 it is ordered that &ldquo;the shield of the
States armes being the Redd Cross and Harpe be taken downe in the
Court <!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>Hall and the King&rsquo;s arms put
in the Roome thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But even the King could not impose on the hospital.&nbsp; Thus
in 1661 there was a vacancy for a surgeon at the Lock.&nbsp; The
King wrote in favour of John Knight, but John Dorrington was
elected (ii., p. 316).</p>
<p>In 1666 the great fire of London was only prevented from
reaching the hospital by pulling down houses.&nbsp; The
consequent loss to the hospital may be set down as &pound;2000
per annum.&nbsp; We are constantly meeting in the history of St
Bartholomew&rsquo;s interesting lights on the natural history of
the patients.&nbsp; An entry as to the supply of beer (of which,
by the way, the patients were allowed three pints daily) pleases
me:&mdash;&ldquo;Sir Jonathan Reymond, Knt. and Alderman, is to
serve the matron&rsquo;s cellar.&nbsp; Alderman Lt.-col. Freind
is to supply small beer&rdquo; (ii., p. 339).&nbsp; These
personages doubtless belonged to the established church, for
dissenters were not allowed to serve the hospital with any
commodity.</p>
<p>An entry under 26th February 1704 throws a sinister light on
the condition of the wards:&mdash;&ldquo;Elizabeth Bond did
propose to kill and clear the beds and wards of bugs within this
house for 6s. per bed.&rdquo;&nbsp; I hope Elizabeth Bond was
more careful in her work than was the writer of the resolution
(ii., p. 352).</p>
<p>It is interesting to come across the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>21<i>st July</i> 1737.&mdash;It was resolved &ldquo;that the
thanks of this Court be given to William Hogarth, Esquire . . .
for his generous and free gift of the painting of the great
staircase. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>5<i>th Jan.</i> 1758.&mdash;A committee considered the <!--
page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>subject of visiting prisoners in Newgate, but the plan
was apparently thrown over because prisoners were found entirely
destitute of clothes, bedding, etc.</p>
<p>Even in the history of Mr Pickwick (chapter xlii.) we read
that &ldquo;not a week passes over our heads, but, in every one
of our prisons for debt, some . . . must inevitably expire in the
slow agonies of want, if they were not relieved by their fellow
prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is curious to find that in 1821 the function of the
hospital as a school for students of medicine was something of a
novelty.&nbsp; The reform seems to have been due to
Abernethy.</p>
<p>In 1845, on 13th May, a unanimous resolution against female
governors was carried.&nbsp; Dr Moore adds that &ldquo;about half
a century later they were admitted, and no disastrous
consequences have ensued.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1851 Miss Elizabeth
Blackwell was actually admitted as a student, and strange to say
with satisfactory results.</p>
<p>The author relates <a name="citation154"></a><a
href="#footnote154" class="citation">[154]</a> how he was walking
back to St Bartholomew&rsquo;s one hot summer afternoon when he
saw at a small second-hand book shop Paulus Jovius&rsquo; history
of his own times, printed in 1550.&nbsp; Within it Woodhull the
collector had noted that he bought it at the sale of Dr
Askew&rsquo;s books.&nbsp; Next day Sir Norman met Robert
Browning and mentioned the book to him: &ldquo;He had read it,
and recalled passages in it, and told most pleasantly how the
bishop had concealed the manuscript in a <!-- page 155--><a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>chest . . .
when the Spaniards took Rome, and how a Spanish captain found out
that Paulus Jovius valued the manuscript, and so only gave it up
on receiving a promise of the emoluments of a living in the gift
of the church&rdquo; (ii., p. 539).</p>
<p>Sir George Burrows became physician in 1841:&mdash;&ldquo;He
did not hesitate to express censure where he thought censure
required.&nbsp; A clergyman at St Bartholomew&rsquo;s rather
aggressively invited his criticism on a sermon which he had just
delivered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let me tell you, sir,&rsquo; said
Burrows, &lsquo;that many a man has been put in a lunatic asylum
for much less nonsense than you preached to us
to-day&rsquo;&rdquo; (ii., p. 561).</p>
<p>Dr Frederic John Farre was elected physician, 1854.&nbsp;
Farre was captain of Charterhouse School during Thackeray&rsquo;s
first year there.&nbsp; And in <i>The Adventures of Philip</i>
the author tells how one of the boys laughed because
Firmin&rsquo;s eyes &ldquo;filled with tears at some ribald
remark, and was gruffly rebuked by Sampson major [<i>i.e.</i>, Dr
Farre], the cock of the whole school; and with the question,
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you see the poor beggar&rsquo;s in mourning,
you great brute?&rsquo; was kicked about his business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Percivall Pott was elected assistant surgeon at St
Bartholomew&rsquo;s in 1745 and surgeon in 1749, holding office
till 1787.&nbsp; There is in the hospital a fine portrait of him
in a crimson coat, by Sir Joshua Reynolds.&nbsp; A very old lady,
whose mother&rsquo;s medical attendant had been dresser to
Percivall Pott, told Dr Moore, on the authority of the above
practitioner, that Pott often came to the hospital in a red coat,
and sometimes wore a sword.</p>
<p><!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>Occasional teaching in medicine had been carried out
from the seventeenth century onwards, but the originator <i>par
excellence</i> was John Abernethy, who was born in 1764 and
became a pupil at St Bartholomew&rsquo;s in 1779.&nbsp; He taught
anatomy in a really scientific manner, but he did not succeed in
permanently raising it from the region of cram which in my day at
Cambridge it shared with Materia Medica.</p>
<p>Many stories are told of his abrupt manner with his private
patients.&nbsp; Charles Darwin used to tell us of a patient
entering Abernethy&rsquo;s consulting room, holding out his hand
and saying, &ldquo;Bad cut,&rdquo; to which Abernethy replied,
&ldquo;Poultice&rdquo;; the patient departed, only to return in a
day or two, when his laconic report, &ldquo;Cut worse,&rdquo; was
answered by &ldquo;More poultice.&rdquo;&nbsp; Finally he came
back cured and enquired what he owed the surgeon, who replied,
&ldquo;Nothing; you are the best patient I ever had, and I could
not take a fee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir James Paget was assistant surgeon at St
Bartholomew&rsquo;s in 1847; he became surgeon in 1861; he
resigned the position in 1871, and died in 1899.&nbsp; He was the
chief surgeon of the Victorian age, and his success may be
estimated by the fact that his professional income rose to
&pound;10,000 per annum.&nbsp; He freely gave of his store of
knowledge, for instance in Charles Darwin&rsquo;s <i>The
Expression of the Emotions</i>.&nbsp; William Morrant Baker was
elected a surgeon of St Bartholomew&rsquo;s in 1882.&nbsp; He was
noted for the neatness of his dress, and Dr Francis Harris, who
sometimes wore country clothes, told Dr Moore that <!-- page
157--><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>he
occasionally hid in the porter&rsquo;s lodge to avoid
Baker&rsquo;s critical eyes.&nbsp; He warned Dr Moore (who was a
candidate for the Wardenship of the College) that those same eyes
were on him in the matter of dress.</p>
<p>Sir William Church, who wrote on the Hospital
Pharmacop&oelig;ia, gives some astonishing facts.&nbsp; From 1866
to 1875 the annual consumption of sulphate of magnesia was
42&frac12; hundredweights, <i>i.e.</i>, about two
cart-loads.&nbsp; &ldquo;In 1836 8&frac34; tons of linseed meal
were used, while from 1876 to 1885 the annual average was
15&frac34; tons, but in 1911 the poultice was so nearly obsolete
that 3 cwt. sufficed.&nbsp; In 1837 96,300 leeches were used; . .
. in 1868 the number had sunk to 2200. . . .&nbsp; It is now
(1911) about 700&rdquo; (ii., p. 714).</p>
<p>Chloroform first appears in the apothecaries&rsquo; ledger on
22nd November 1847, just one week after the publication of Sir
James Y. Simpson&rsquo;s treatise.</p>
<p>A pound of pure carbolic acid was used in 1865, in 1911 the
quantity was 2&frac12; tons.&nbsp; Nurses have increased from a
&ldquo;matron and eleven sisters in the reign of King Edward VI.
to the matron, assistant-matron, thirty-eight sisters, and 268
nurses who form the highly trained nursing staff of the present
day&rdquo; (ii., p. 778).</p>
<p>I cannot resist quoting a reminiscence of Mr Mark Morris, the
Steward of the Hospital, who was born early enough to remember
&ldquo;several cases . . . of wives who had been sold in
Smithfield.&nbsp; A rope was loosely thrown round them, and as
the seller handed the end of the rope to the buyer, the buyer
gave him a shilling.&nbsp; The new marriage was regarded <!--
page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>. . . as in every way reputable and complete&rdquo;
(ii., p. 789).</p>
<p>We have space for but a few of Dr Moore&rsquo;s pleasant
reminiscences.&nbsp; A woman came from South Wales whose only
language was Welsh.&nbsp; Her husband&rsquo;s native language was
Irish, and he had learned Welsh, but could speak no
English.&nbsp; A scavenger came into the Casualty Department
named Michael O&rsquo;Clery.&nbsp; &ldquo;An illustrious
name,&rdquo; said the physician (N. M.?) remembering a certain
famous chronicler.&nbsp; The scavenger explained accurately to
which part of the family of hereditary historians he
belonged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another patient, a shoemaker . . . gave the name of
Conellan.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you ever heard,&rsquo; said the
physician, &lsquo;of Owen Conellan, who wrote a
grammar?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;My relation,&rsquo; replied the
patient, &lsquo;historiographer to His Majesty King George
IV.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus was the physician instructed in the
biography of the grammarian&rdquo; (ii., p. 873).</p>
<p>A mountebank, who gained his living by thrusting a sword,
about a foot long, down his gullet was admitted to a surgical
ward.&nbsp; The treatment consisted in putting probangs of
india-rubber down the gullet, and in this the patient was more
adroit than the highly skilled surgeon who attended him (ii., p.
874).</p>
<p>I like, too, the case of a patient who was described as an
&ldquo;arrow-maker,&rdquo; and on being asked whether he did not
call himself a fletcher, said, &ldquo;Yes, but I thought you
would not know.&rdquo;&nbsp; We read, also, of ruler-makers with
&ldquo;their hair turned green by the <!-- page 159--><a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>resin dust
produced by their lathes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Also of &ldquo;secret
springers and piercers,&rdquo; who suggest murder and sudden
death to the imperfectly informed.</p>
<p>The following incident (ii., p. 883) is interesting from the
point of view of history:&mdash;A negro, Jonathan Strong, had
been brutally beaten by his master, and was admitted to the
hospital in 1765.&nbsp; On leaving he got work at a
chemist&rsquo;s in the city; all seemed well, when he was
recognised by an agent of his former master, and seized as
&ldquo;the property of Mr Kerr.&rdquo;&nbsp; Granville Sharp, who
happened to be present, at once charged the agent with committing
an assault.&nbsp; An action brought against Sharp lingered on for
some time and was finally dropped.&nbsp; Strong remained free,
but the general question of slavery in England was not settled
till 1772.&nbsp; It is pleasant to know that in 1877 Dr Moore
told the story of Jonathan Strong to William Lloyd Garrison.</p>
<h2><!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>SIR GEORGE AIRY <a
name="citation161"></a><a href="#footnote161"
class="citation">[161]</a></h2>
<p>In attempting to estimate this book, it is necessary to avoid
first impressions, for what strikes one on opening its pages is
its dullness.&nbsp; It is edited by his son, who, in a
<i>Personal Sketch</i>, gives certain facts about his father
without succeeding in being graphic or interesting in any
way.&nbsp; There is too much detail of an unexciting quality,
<i>e.g.</i>, p. 272 (1867): &ldquo;There was the usual visit to
Playford in January.&nbsp; In April there was a short run to
Alnwick and the neighbourhood in company with Mr and Mrs
Routh.&nbsp; From 27th June to 4th July he was in Wales with his
two eldest (<i>sic</i>) sons, visiting Uriconium, etc., on his
return.&nbsp; From 8th August to 7th September he spent a holiday
in Scotland and the Lake District of Cumberland with his daughter
Christabel, visiting the Langtons at Barrow House, near Keswick,
and Isaac Fletcher at Tarn Bank.&rdquo;&nbsp; When this kind of
thing occurs often it is intolerably wearisome.</p>
<p>The same criticism applies to the extracts from Sir George
Airy&rsquo;s diary, which his son publishes.&nbsp; <!-- page
162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>For instance, p. 172 (1845): &ldquo;On 29th January I
went with my wife on a visit to my uncle, George Biddell, at
Bradfield St George, near Bury.&nbsp; On 9th June I went into the
mining district of Cornwall with George Arthur Biddell.&nbsp;
From 25th August to 26th September I was travelling in France
with my sister and my wife&rsquo;s sister, Georgiana Smith.&nbsp;
I was well introduced and the journey was interesting.&nbsp; On
29th October my son Osmond was born.&nbsp; Mr F. Baily bequeathed
to me &pound;500, which realised &pound;450.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a class of facts which a man may like to record, but
their publication when so often repeated is surely
unnecessary.&nbsp; There is, however, this to be said&mdash;that
minute accuracy was a marked feature in Airy&rsquo;s character,
and must therefore be made prominent; and it may be argued that
the right degree of prominence can only be given by avoiding all
suppression.&nbsp; I cannot think that this is so in the case of
an editor.&nbsp; Nor can I believe that Airy would have approved
of one detail in his son&rsquo;s method of printing the book,
namely, that the diary is enclosed in inverted commas throughout,
while the editor&rsquo;s occasional remarks are without
them.&nbsp; It would surely have been simpler to say once for all
that what is printed is an accurate copy of the diary, and to
have given the editor&rsquo;s remarks within square brackets.</p>
<p>George Biddell Airy was born at Alnwick on 27th July
1801.&nbsp; He seems to have belonged to a Westmoreland family,
but his forbears for several generations were small farmers in
Lincolnshire.&nbsp; <!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>His father, William Airy, was
clearly a person of energy and forethought, who laid by his
summer&rsquo;s earnings &ldquo;in order to educate himself in
winter.&rdquo;&nbsp; He gave up farming as a young man and found
employment in the excise, a profession not without danger in
those early days when contraband trade was common.&nbsp; He is
said to have had many fights with smugglers, but did not suffer
the fate of the gauger in <i>Guy Mannering</i>, for Dirck
Hatteraicks were not so common as youthful readers might
desire.</p>
<p>In 1810 William Airy was transferred to Colchester, where, if
there were fewer smugglers, there was more opportunity for
education; and George was sent to a school in a street bearing
the attractive name of Sir Isaac&rsquo;s Walk.&nbsp; Four years
later Airy went to the Colchester Grammar School, where he
remained until 1819, when he entered Trinity College,
Cambridge.&nbsp; The only point of interest connected with his
school life is the record (in his own words) of Airy&rsquo;s
remarkable verbal memory.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was the custom for each
boy once a week to repeat a number of lines of Latin or Greek
poetry, the number depending very much on his own choice.&nbsp; I
determined on repeating 100 every week. . . .&nbsp; It was no
distress to me, and great enjoyment.&nbsp; At Michaelmas 1816 I
repeated 2394 lines, probably without missing a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On 18th October 1819 he went to Cambridge &ldquo;on the top of
the coach,&rdquo; and was installed in lodgings in Bridge
Street.&nbsp; A reputation for mathematics had preceded him, and
he was kindly received <!-- page 164--><a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>by Mr
Peacock <a name="citation164"></a><a href="#footnote164"
class="citation">[164]</a> and Professor Sedgwick.&nbsp; It will
be remembered that some twenty years later both these personages
interested themselves in another Cambridge
undergraduate&mdash;Charles Darwin.</p>
<p>Airy (p. 23) showed Mr Peacock a manuscript book containing
&ldquo;a number of original Propositions&rdquo; which he had
investigated.&nbsp; This increased his reputation in the
University, but he was destined to be eminent in quite another
direction.&nbsp; On the recommendation of Clarkson&mdash;who, as
the chief Abolitionist, ought to have been more
revolutionary&mdash;he followed the rule almost universally
neglected&mdash;that undergraduates should wear drab knee
breeches.&nbsp; Though Airy must soon have discovered that the
reign of breeches was over, he continued, like the careful youth
he was, to wear them for three terms.</p>
<p>In the winter of his freshman&rsquo;s year, he did some
original research in mathematics.&nbsp; This praiseworthy
undertaking was characteristically treated by two of his
advisers: Mr Peacock encouraged him to work out his problems; but
his tutor (who bore the appropriate name of Hustler) disapproved
of Airy&rsquo;s employing his time on such speculations.</p>

165</span>He describes with characteristic precision his way of
life as an undergraduate.&nbsp; He never failed to keep the four
statutory morning chapels.&nbsp; Then came breakfast, and College
lectures occupied him from nine till eleven.&nbsp; He then went
back to his rooms, and instead of at once getting to his
mathematics, he wrote a piece of Latin prose.&nbsp; At two
o&rsquo;clock he &ldquo;went out for a long walk, usually 4 or 5
miles, into the country: sometimes if I found companions I rowed
on the Cam (a practice acquired rather later)&rdquo;; College
Hall was at four, after which he &ldquo;lounged&rdquo; until it
was time to go to evening chapel (five-thirty).&nbsp; About six
he had tea, and then &ldquo;read quietly, usually a classical
subject, till eleven; and I never, even in the times when I might
seem most severely pressed, sat up later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his second year he was asked to coach one Rosser, a man of
his own year, for which he was paid at the rate of &pound;14 per
term.&nbsp; &ldquo;This occupied two hours every day, and I felt
that I was now completely earning my own living.&nbsp; I never
received a penny from my friends after this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His undergraduate life ended triumphantly in his being Senior
Wrangler.&nbsp; He refers (p. 39) to the hardships of the
examination: &ldquo;The season was a cold one, and no fire was
allowed in the Senate House, where the examination was carried on
. . . and altogether it was a severe time.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
reference to the ceremonial of degree-taking has a little
self-glorification which is not characteristic of
him:&mdash;&ldquo;I, as Senior Wrangler, was led up first to
receive the <!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>degree, and rarely has the Senate
House rung with such applause as then filled it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In January 1823 he came back to Cambridge and started business
as a coach with four pupils, each of whom paid him twenty guineas
a term. <a name="citation166"></a><a href="#footnote166"
class="citation">[166]</a>&nbsp; By this time the great series of
his published papers had begun&mdash;indeed No. 1, &ldquo;On the
use of Silvered Glass for the mirrors of Reflecting
Telescopes,&rdquo; had already been published in 1822, by the
Cambridge Philosophical Society.</p>
<p>It was in 1824 that &ldquo;came one of the most important
occurrences&rdquo; of his life, namely, meeting the beautiful
girl Richarda Smith, who was to become his wife.&nbsp; They were
engaged in 1824 and married six years later.&nbsp; I venture the
guess that her health was never very strong, for she seems not to
have been much with Airy in his holiday wanderings.&nbsp; Wilfrid
Airy speaks of &ldquo;their deep respect and affection for one
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On 1st October 1824, in his twenty-third year, he was elected
to a Trinity fellowship.&nbsp; Macaulay, who was elected the same
day, speaks somewhere of the especial value he placed on this
most pleasant honour, but he was thinking of the life of a
resident Fellow, and Airy at once told his tutor of his intention
of going out into the world.&nbsp; He began, however, in the
October term to give mathematical lectures in Trinity.&nbsp; The
reader is not surprised to find that Airy now gave up the custom
which he &ldquo;had followed with such regularity for five years,
<!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>namely, that of daily writing Latin.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
wonder what other Senior Wrangler wrote Latin prose while reading
for the Tripos?</p>
<p>We have seen that the great stream of his original work had
been established.&nbsp; In 1822 he wrote one paper, in 1824
three, in 1825 two, in 1826 three, and in 1827 five; and this
stream was to flow for sixty-five years, <i>i.e.</i>, until
1887!</p>
<p>On December 1826 he was elected to the Lucasian professorship,
and thus became a successor of Sir Isaac Newton.&nbsp; The salary
when Airy was elected was but &pound;99 a year; the present
holder is more adequately paid, and receives &pound;850
annually.&nbsp; His prospects in 1827 were, however, not very
good.&nbsp; He had to resign his tutorship when he became a
professor, and thus lost &pound;51 of income.&nbsp; As he would
not take orders, his fellowship, according to the atrocious
system of the day, would come to an end in seven years.&nbsp; But
he surely judged wisely in accepting the poorly paid
office.&nbsp; He had to lecture in a room, not intended for the
purpose, in the old Botanic Gardens.&nbsp; This region is now
occupied by science buildings, but bears a memory of its former
history in the great <i>Sophora</i> tree flourishing there.</p>
<p>He was soon to obtain better paid work, for in 1828 he was
elected Plumian professor, and giving up his college rooms he
moved into the Observatory, where his official career as an
astronomer began.&nbsp; During the following years, up to 1834,
he was busy with professorial work and his duties at the
Cambridge Observatory.&nbsp; He began to receive public
acknowledgments of his character and his work.&nbsp; In <!-- page
168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>1835 he was elected a correspondent of the French
Academy.&nbsp; In the same year Sir Robert Peel (p. 106) offered
him a pension of &pound;300 per annum, with no terms of any kind,
and allowing it to be settled, &ldquo;if I should think fit, on
my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On 11th June 1835 the First Lord of the Admiralty wrote
offering Airy the office of Astronomer Royal, which was
accepted.&nbsp; Another honour&mdash;that of Knighthood&mdash;he
declined in the same year.&nbsp; In 1863 the same honour was
again offered and declined with dignity, on the ground that fees
of &ldquo;about &pound;30&rdquo; were demanded.&nbsp; Finally, in
1872 he was offered the K.C.B. and knighted by the Queen at
Osborne.&nbsp; In reply to the congratulations of a friend, Airy
wrote: &ldquo;The real charm of these public compliments seems to
be, that they excite the sympathies and elicit the kind
expressions of private friends or of official superiors as well
as subordinates.&nbsp; In every way I have derived pleasure from
these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With regard to other honours, it is pleasant to discover that
Airy, one of the most accurate of men, could make minute
mistakes.&nbsp; Thus in 1863 he speaks (p. 254) of the academical
degree of D.C.L. held by him in the Universities of Oxford and
Cambridge.&nbsp; But at Cambridge the degree in question is known
as LL.D.</p>
<p>It may be well to give here, irrespective of dates, some of
the other honours received by Airy.</p>
<p>In 1867 he (in company with Connop Thirlwall) was elected to
the newly instituted Honorary Fellowships of Trinity&mdash;a
distinction which seems to have given him especial pleasure.</p>
<p><!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>In 1872 he was chosen as &ldquo;Foreign Associate of
the Institut de France&rdquo; (p. 297), and wrote a strongly
worded letter of thanks to Elie de Beaumont and J. B. Dumas, the
Perpetual Secretaries.&nbsp; In the same year he wrote (p. 299)
to the Emperor of Brazil in acknowledgment of the Grand Cross of
the Rose of Brazil.</p>
<p>In 1851 he was President of the British Association at
Ipswich.&nbsp; He showed his sense of duty in a characteristic
way (p. 207).&nbsp; &ldquo;Prince Albert was present, as [a]
guest of Sir William Middleton; I was engaged to meet him at
dinner, but when I found that the dinner day was one of the
principal soir&eacute;e days, I broke off the
engagement.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1871 Airy was chosen President of the
Royal Society.&nbsp; He wrote to a friend (p. 293): &ldquo;The
election . . . is flattering, and has brought to me the friendly
remembrance of many persons; but in its material and laborious
connections, I could well have dispensed with it, and should have
done so but for the respectful way in which it was pressed on
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He resigned the Presidency in 1873 (p. 303),
giving his reasons as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The severity of
official duties, which seem to increase, while vigour to
discharge them does not increase; and the distance of my
residence. . . .&nbsp; Another reason is a difficulty of hearing,
which unfits me for effective action as Chairman of the
Council.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is quite beyond my powers to estimate the value of
Airy&rsquo;s work as Astronomer Royal; I therefore quote from
Schuster and Shipley&rsquo;s <i>Britain&rsquo;s Heritage of
Science</i>, p. 165:&mdash;&ldquo;In astronomy he proved himself
to be equally eminent as an <!-- page 170--><a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>administrator and investigator.&nbsp; He introduced
revolutionary reforms in the practice of observatories by
insisting on a rapid reduction and publication of all
observations.&nbsp; After his appointment as Astronomer Royal, he
set to work at once to reduce the series of observations of
planets which had accumulated during eighty years without any use
having been made of them.&nbsp; This was followed up by a similar
reduction of 8000 lunar observations.&nbsp; He was equally
energetic in adding to the instrumental equipment.&nbsp; When
Greenwich was first founded, the longitude determination at sea
depended to a great extent on measuring the distance between
stars and the moon.&nbsp; Hence accurate tables of the position
of the moon were essential, and the preparation of these tables
has always been considered to be the chief care of
Greenwich.&nbsp; The observations were made with a transit
telescope which could only be used when the moon was passing the
meridian, until Airy in 1843 persuaded the Board of Visitors to
take steps for constructing a new instrument which would enable
him to observe the moon in any position.&nbsp; In 1847 this
instrument was at work, and other important additions to the
equipment were made as occasion arose. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among his theoretical investigations in pure astronomy,
one of the most important resulted in the discovery of a new
inequality in the motions of Venus and the earth due to their
mutual attraction, and this led to an improvement in the solar
tables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor should it be forgotten that Airy &ldquo;originated <!--
page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>the automatic system by which the Greenwich time
signals are transmitted each day throughout the
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With regard to the celebrated case of the planet Neptune,
&ldquo;which Adams predicted would be found&mdash;as it was found
by the Berlin observer Galle, to whom Leverrier indicated its
position,&rdquo; Messrs Schuster and Shipley &ldquo;cannot
absolve either Airy or Challis [the Cambridge Astronomer] from
blame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Airy writes (p. 181): &ldquo;The engrossing subject of this
year [1846] was the discovery of Neptune.&nbsp; As I have said
(1845), I obtained no answer from Adams to a letter of
enquiry.&nbsp; Beginning with June 26th of 1846, I had
correspondence of a satisfactory character with Leverrier, who
had taken up the subject of the disturbance of Uranus, and
arrived at conclusions not very different from those of
Adams.&nbsp; I wrote from Ely on July 9th to Challis, begging
him, as in possession of the largest telescope in England, to
sweep for the planet and suggesting a plan.&nbsp; I received
information of its recognition by Galle, when I was visiting
Hansen at Gotha.&nbsp; For further official history, see my
communications to the Royal Astronomical Society, and for private
history see the papers in the Royal Observatory.&nbsp; I was
abused most savagely both by English and French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having been Astronomer Royal from 1835, Airy, being eighty
years of age, resigned his post in 1881, receiving (p. 340) a
&ldquo;retired allowance of &pound;1100 per annum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His son writes (p. 346), &ldquo;On the 16th of August <!--
page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>1881 Airy left the Observatory,&rdquo; which had been
his home &ldquo;for nearly 46 years, and removed to the White
House.&nbsp; Whatever his feeling may have been at the severing
of his old associations he carefully kept them to himself, and
entered upon his new life with the cheerful composure and
steadiness of temper which he possessed in a remarkable
degree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His son continues (p. 347): &ldquo;The work to which he
chiefly devoted himself in his retirement was the completion of
his Numerical Lunar Theory.&nbsp; This was a vast work, involving
the subtlest considerations of principle, very long and elaborate
mathematical investigations of a high order, and an enormous
amount of arithmetical computation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of this work
Airy wrote, p. 349 (apparently in 1886): &ldquo;The critical
trial depends on the great mass of computations in Section
ii.&nbsp; These have been made in duplicate, with all the care
for accuracy that anxiety could supply.&nbsp; Still I cannot but
fear that the error which is the source of discordance must be on
my part.&rdquo;&nbsp; The work was continued until October 1888,
but without success.</p>
<p>He continued to show his characteristic fearlessness in what
he considers to be his duty.&nbsp; Thus in 1883 (p. 355) he
refused to sign a memorial in favour of the burial of Mr
Spottiswoode in Westminster Abbey, on the ground that he had not
conferred &ldquo;great and durable&rdquo; benefits on
society.&nbsp; In 1883 he wrote (p. 356) to the Vicar of
Greenwich protesting against choral service in the church.&nbsp;
I shall quote his words as almost a solitary example of his use
of picturesque English:&mdash;&ldquo;For a venerable persuasion
there is <!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>substituted a rude irreverential
confusion of voices; for an earnest acceptance of the form
offered by the Priest there is substituted&mdash;in my feeling at
least&mdash;a weary waiting for the end of an unmeaning
form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1887 his son records (p. 361) that Airy&rsquo;s private
accounts gave him much trouble.&nbsp; It had been his custom to
keep them by double entry in very perfect order.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
he now began to make mistakes and to grow confused, and this
distressed him greatly . . . and so he struggled with his
accounts as he did with his Lunar Theory till his powers
absolutely failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1889 he had the satisfaction of knowing that his system of
compass correction in iron ships had been universally
adopted.&nbsp; Whether the Admiralty ought to be proud of the
fact that fifty years had elapsed since Airy&rsquo;s discovery
was made known is another question.</p>
<p>Sir George Airy died 2nd January 1892.&nbsp; It is recorded
that before the end came he had been lying quietly for several
days &ldquo;reciting the English poetry with which his memory was
stored.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I thank God, Who has made me poor, that He
has made me merry.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>I.&nbsp; BIOGRAPHICAL.</h3>
<p>Sydney Smith was born in 1771, the son of an eccentric Mr
Robert Smith and his wife, who was the daughter of a French
<i>&eacute;migr&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; Robert Smith is said to have
bought and re-sold something like twenty houses in the course of
his life.&nbsp; This may help to account for Sydney being early
dependent on his own resources.&nbsp; When he was engaged to be
married, he threw six silver teaspoons into his
fianc&eacute;e&rsquo;s lap, saying: &ldquo;There Kate, you lucky
girl, I give you my whole fortune!&rdquo; <a
name="citation175b"></a><a href="#footnote175b"
class="citation">[175b]</a></p>
<p>The only one of Sydney&rsquo;s brothers who need be mentioned
was Robert, commonly called Bobus <a name="citation175c"></a><a
href="#footnote175c" class="citation">[175c]</a> (an Eton
nickname).&nbsp; He once spoke of his mother&rsquo;s beauty in
the presence of Talleyrand, who, &ldquo;with a shrug and a sly
disparaging look,&rdquo; said, &ldquo;Ah! mon <!-- page 176--><a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>ami,
c&rsquo;&eacute;tait donc apparemment monsieur votre p&egrave;re
qui n&rsquo;&eacute;tait pas bien.&rdquo; <a
name="citation176a"></a><a href="#footnote176a"
class="citation">[176a]</a></p>
<p>Sydney went to Winchester on the foundation, where he had to
endure &ldquo;years of misery and positive
starvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; He used to say that he had at school
made about ten thousand Latin verses, &ldquo;and no man in his
senses would dream in after-life of ever making
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sydney passed from Winchester to New College, Oxford, where
his rank as Captain of the School apparently entitled him to a
fellowship.&nbsp; In spite of this he seems to have been poor and
to have lived in consequence very much out of society.&nbsp;
Between Winchester and Oxford he was sent to Mont Villiers in
Normandy to learn French, in which he succeeded admirably.&nbsp;
The revolution was then at its height, and he had to be enrolled
in a Jacobin Club as &ldquo;Le Citoyen Smit, Membre
Affili&eacute;, etc.&rdquo;&nbsp; It speaks well for
Sydney&rsquo;s self-restraint and powers of self-management, that
after he became a Fellow <a name="citation176b"></a><a
href="#footnote176b" class="citation">[176b]</a> of his college
he never received a farthing from his father.&nbsp; On leaving
Oxford he was <i>faute de mieux</i> ordained, and became a curate
at a small village in the middle of Salisbury Plain.&nbsp; Here
he made the acquaintance of the neighbouring squire, Mr
Beach.&nbsp; He became tutor to the squire&rsquo;s son, and it
was arranged that they should go to the University of Weimar; but
this turned out impracticable, and (says Sydney) &ldquo;in stress
of politics we put into Edinburgh,&rdquo; where he <!-- page
177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>remained five years.&nbsp; Here he came in contact with
a number of interesting people&mdash;Jeffrey, <a
name="citation177a"></a><a href="#footnote177a"
class="citation">[177a]</a> Horner, <a name="citation177b"></a><a
href="#footnote177b" class="citation">[177b]</a> Playfair, Walter
Scott, Dugald Stewart, Brougham, Murray, Leyden and others, many
of whom were life-long friends of Sydney.&nbsp; Another eminent
person whose acquaintance he made later, may be mentioned
here.&nbsp; Sydney wrote to Lady Holland in 1831 (ii., p.
326):&mdash;&ldquo;Philosopher Malthus came here last week.&nbsp;
I got an agreeable party for him of unmarried people.&nbsp; There
was only one lady who had had a child; but he is a good-natured
man, and if there are no appearances of approaching fertility, is
civil to every lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sydney&rsquo;s housekeeping difficulties at Edinburgh <!--
page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>proved an unexpected difficulty; his servants
&ldquo;always pulled off their stockings, in spite of my repeated
objurgations, the moment my back was turned.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
cannot resist quoting, <i>apropos des bottes</i>, the following
story.&nbsp; The reigning bore at Edinburgh was X, his favourite
subject the North Pole.&nbsp; Sydney met X, indignant at Jeffrey
having darted past him exclaiming, &ldquo;Damn the North
Pole.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sydney tried to console him: &ldquo;Why, you
will scarcely believe it, but it is not more than a week ago that
I heard him speak disrespectfully of the Equator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1799 or 1800 he was married to Miss Pybus, and in 1802,
when a child was about to be born, Sydney hoped it would be a
girl, and that she might have but one eye so that she might never
marry.&nbsp; Part of the wish was fulfilled; the baby was a girl,
but, unfortunately, quite normal in every way.&nbsp; Saba, for so
she was called (a name <a name="citation178a"></a><a
href="#footnote178a" class="citation">[178a]</a> invented by her
father), ultimately became the wife of Sir Henry Holland, the
well-known physician.</p>
<p>About this time Sydney suggested to Jeffrey and Brougham the
foundation of a Liberal Quarterly&mdash;in those days a
contradiction in terms&mdash;which was named the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i> after the town of its birth.&nbsp; Sydney proposed as
a motto, &ldquo;<i>Tenui Musam meditamur avena</i>,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;We cultivate literature on a little
oatmeal,&rdquo; but this was too near the truth to be admitted.
<a name="citation178b"></a><a href="#footnote178b"
class="citation">[178b]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>Throughout his life literature was combined with
vigorous activity as a clergyman.&nbsp; Speaking of two or three
&ldquo;random sermons&rdquo; which he &ldquo;discharged&rdquo; in
London, he says he believed that the congregation thought him
mad.&nbsp; &ldquo;The clerk was as pale as death in helping me
off with my gown, for fear I should bite him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made many friends in London.&nbsp; Among these he specially
valued Lord and Lady Holland, with whom he often stayed.&nbsp;
They agreed in gaiety, humour, and political opinions.&nbsp; And
it must be remembered that a Liberal parson was a rare bird in
those days.&nbsp; Dugald Stewart (i., p. 127) said of Sydney
Smith&rsquo;s preaching, &ldquo;Those original and unexpected
ideas gave me a thrilling sensation of sublimity never before
awakened by any other oratory.&rdquo;&nbsp; But his most
celebrated triumph was a charity sermon which actually moved old
Lady C. (Cork?) to borrow a sovereign to put in the plate.</p>
<p>Sydney lectured on Moral Philosophy at the Royal
Institution.&nbsp; Many years afterwards, in 1843, he wrote to
Whewell: &ldquo;My lectures are gone to the dogs, and are utterly
forgotten.&nbsp; I knew nothing of moral philosophy, but I was
thoroughly aware that I wanted &pound;200 to furnish my
house.&nbsp; The success, however, was prodigious; all Albemarle
Street blocked with carriages, and such an uproar as I never
remembered to have been excited by any other literary
impostor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leonard Horner wrote: &ldquo;Nobody else, to be sure, could
have executed such an undertaking.&nbsp; For who could make such
a mixture of odd paradox, quaint <!-- page 180--><a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>fun, manly
sense, Liberal opinions, and striking language?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He used, like Charles Lamb, to give weekly suppers.&nbsp; Sir
James Mackintosh brought to one of these parties &ldquo;a raw
Scotch cousin, an ensign in a Highland regiment.&nbsp; On hearing
the name of his host he . . . said in an audible whisper,
&lsquo;Is that the great Sir Sudney?&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mackintosh gave a hint to Sydney, who &ldquo;performed the part
of the hero of Acre to perfection,&rdquo; to the &ldquo;torture
of the other guests, who were bursting with suppressed
laughter.&rdquo;&nbsp; A few days later Sydney and his wife met
Mackintosh and the wonderful cousin in the street, to whom Sydney
introduced his wife.&nbsp; The Scotch youth didna&rsquo; ken the
great Sir Sudney was married.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; said
Sir James, &ldquo;. . . not exactly married; only an Egyptian
slave. . . .&nbsp; Fatima&mdash;you know&mdash;you
understand.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs Smith was long known as Fatima.</p>
<p>With regard to Sydney&rsquo;s talk, his daughter speaks of
&ldquo;the multitude of unexpected images which sprang up in his
mind, and succeeded each other with a rapidity that hardly
allowed his hearers to follow him, but left them panting and
exhausted with laughter, to cry out for mercy.&rdquo;&nbsp; When
he met Mrs Siddons for the first time she &ldquo;seemed
determined to resist him, and preserve her tragic dignity,&rdquo;
but finally she fell into such a &ldquo;paroxysm of laughter . .
. that it made quite a scene, and all the company were
alarmed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1807 Sydney&rsquo;s first <i>Letter from Peter Plymley to
his brother Abraham</i> appeared.&nbsp; It was on the Irish <!--
page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>Catholic question, and made a great
sensation&mdash;Government trying to discover the author,
etc.&nbsp; Lord Murray said, &ldquo;After <i>Pascal&rsquo;s
Letters</i>, it is the most instructive piece of wisdom in the
form of irony ever written, and had the most important and
lasting effects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About the year 1806 he was presented to the living of Foston
le Clay in Yorkshire through Lord Holland&rsquo;s interest.&nbsp;
He had to build a parsonage &ldquo;without experience or
money,&rdquo; and to make a journey with family and furniture
&ldquo;into the heart of Yorkshire&mdash;a process, in the year
1808, as difficult as a journey to the back settlements of
America now.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had, moreover, to turn farmer, since
the living consisted of 300 acres of land and no tithe.&nbsp; The
local Squire was shy of him as a Jacobin, but finally they became
fast friends.&nbsp; He used to &ldquo;bring the papers, that I
might explain the difficult words to him; actually discovered
that I had made a joke, laughed till I thought he would have died
of convulsions, and ended by inviting me to see his
dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was advised to employ oxen on his farm, which, however,
turned out a failure; but their names deserve remembrance, for
they were christened Tug and Lug, Haul and Crawl.&nbsp; He looked
after his men through a telescope, and gave orders with a
speaking-trumpet.&nbsp; He records &ldquo;that a man-servant was
too expensive&rdquo; for him, so &ldquo;I caught up a little
garden-girl, made like a milestone, christened her Bunch, put a
napkin in her hand, and made her my butler.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
became &ldquo;the best butler in the county.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bunch
is described as pacing up and <!-- page 182--><a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>down before
her master&rsquo;s door, saying, &ldquo;Oh, ma&rsquo;am, I
can&rsquo;t get no peace of mind till I&rsquo;ve got master
shaved.&rdquo;&nbsp; This meant &ldquo;making ready for him with
a large painter&rsquo;s brush, a thick lather in a huge wooden
bowl.&rdquo;&nbsp; A visitor at Foston records:&mdash;&ldquo;Mr
Smith suddenly said to Bunch, who was passing, &lsquo;Bunch, do
you like roast duck or boiled chicken?&rsquo;&nbsp; Bunch had
probably never tasted either the one or the other in her life,
but answered, without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, &lsquo;Roast
duck, please, sir,&rsquo; and disappeared.&nbsp; I laughed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You may laugh,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but you have no idea
of the labour it has cost me to give her that decision of
character.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Bunch used to be told to repeat her crimes, and gravely
recited, &ldquo;Plate-snatching, gravy-spilling, door-slamming,
blue-bottle-fly-catching, and curtsey-bobbing.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
blue-bottle crime was standing with her mouth open and not
attending.&nbsp; Curtsey-bobbing was &ldquo;Curtseying to the
centre of the earth, please, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One little fact is worth recording.&nbsp; In 1825 a meeting of
clergy was held in Yorkshire to petition Parliament against the
emancipation of the Catholics.&nbsp; Sydney&rsquo;s was the only
dissentient voice.&nbsp; No doubt in those days it was hard for a
Liberal parson to get preferment, and George III. was right in
his prophecy that Sydney would never be a bishop.&nbsp; But in
January 1828 the Chancellor, Lord Lyndhurst, bestowed on Sydney a
stall then vacant at Bristol.&nbsp; This was not of much
importance from a pecuniary point of view, but it broke the
&ldquo;spell which had <!-- page 183--><a

class="citation">[183]</a>&nbsp; In the autumn of that year he
preached toleration to the Mayor and Corporation of Bristol, the
&ldquo;most Protestant civic body in England.&rdquo;&nbsp; About
the same time he exchanged his living in Yorkshire for that of
Combe Florey near Taunton.</p>
<p>In 1831 (i., p. 290) Lord Grey appointed him to a Prebendal
Stall at St Paul&rsquo;s in exchange for the inferior one at
Bristol.&nbsp; With regard to ecclesiastical preferment, he wrote
to Lady Holland (8th October 1808): You &ldquo;may choose to make
me a bishop, and if you do I . . . shall never do you discredit,
for I believe it is out of the power of lawn and velvet, and the
crisp hair of dead men fashioned into a wig, to make me a
dishonest man; but if you do not, I am perfectly content, and
shall be ever grateful to the last hour of my life to you and to
Lord Holland.&rdquo;&nbsp; And to Lady Mary Bennett, July 1820,
p. 200: &ldquo;Lord Liverpool&rsquo;s messenger mistook the way,
and instead of bringing the mitre to me, took it to my next-door
neighbour, Dr Carey, who very fraudulently accepted it.&nbsp;
Lord Liverpool is extremely angry, and I am to have the
next!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to Murray: &ldquo;I think Lord Grey will give me some
preferment, if he stays in long enough; but the upper parsons
live vindictively.&nbsp; The Bishop of --- has the rancour to
recover after three paralytic strokes, and the Dean of --- to be
vigorous at <!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>eighty-two.&nbsp; And yet these are
men who are called Christians!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the following letter to Lord John Russell (3rd April 1837,
p. 399) he is for once in a way egoistic:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I defy X to quote a single passage in my writing
contrary to the doctrines of the Church of England; for I have
always avoided speculative, and preached practical,
religion.&nbsp; I defy him to mention a single action in my life
which he can call immoral. . . .&nbsp; I am distinguished as a
preacher, and sedulous as a parochial clergyman.&nbsp; His real
charge is, that I am a high-spirited, honest, uncompromising man,
whom all the bench of bishops could not turn, and who would set
them all at defiance upon great and vital questions. . . .&nbsp;
I am thoroughly sincere in saying I would not take any bishopric
whatever, and to this I pledge my honour and character as a
gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It came to Sydney&rsquo;s turn to appoint to the valuable
living of Edmonton: he was allowed to take it himself, but he
gave it to the son of the late parson, Tate.&nbsp; Sydney said to
Tate junior, that by an odd coincidence the new vicar was called
Tate, and by a more singular chance Thomas Tate, &ldquo;in short
. . . you are vicar of Edmonton.&rdquo;&nbsp; They all burst into
tears, and &ldquo;I wept and groaned for a long time.&nbsp; Then
I rose, and said I thought it was very likely to end in their
keeping a buggy, at which we all laughed as violently. . .
.&nbsp; The charitable physician wept too&rdquo; (i., p.
343).&nbsp; He wrote to:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Grote</span>, 3<i>rd Jan.</i>
1844.&mdash;&ldquo;You have seen <!-- page 185--><a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>more than
enough of my giving the living of Edmonton to a curate.&nbsp; The
first thing the unscriptural curate does, is to turn out his
fellow curate, the son of him who was vicar before his father. .
. .&nbsp; The Bishop, the Dean and Chapter, and I have in vain
expostulated; he perseveres in his harshness and
cruelty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Towards the end of 1843 he made his well-known attack on the
scandal of the State of Pennsylvania not paying interest to
English investors&mdash;he being one.&nbsp; He declares them to
be &ldquo;men who prefer any load of infamy, however great, to
any pressure of taxation, however light&rdquo; (i., p. 352).</p>
<p>Sydney Smith died 22nd February 1845 from disease of the
heart.&nbsp; He was buried at Kensal Green &ldquo;as privately as
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Macaulay <a name="citation185"></a><a href="#footnote185"
class="citation">[185]</a> wrote in 1847 to Mrs Sydney: &ldquo;He
is universally admitted to have been a great reasoner, and the
greatest master of ridicule that has appeared among us since
Swift.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs Sydney adds in a note that there is not a
line in his writing &ldquo;unfit for the eye of a woman,&rdquo; a
great contrast to Swift.</p>
<h2>2.&nbsp; LETTERS.</h2>
<p>In 1807&ndash;8 appeared anonymously Sydney Smith&rsquo;s
<i>Letters on the Subject of the Catholics to my brother Abraham
who lives in the Country</i>, by Peter Plymley.</p>
<p><!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>Abraham is said to be a &ldquo;kind of holy
vegetable&rdquo; and to be a type of people who were
exclaiming:&mdash;&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t think
of raising cavalry and infantry in Ireland! . . .&nbsp; They
interpret the Epistle to Timothy in a different manner to what we
do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sydney points out (in his character of Peter Plymley) that the
&ldquo;Catholic is excluded from Parliament because he will not
swear that he disbelieves the leading doctrines of his
religion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He refers to Perceval in the following passage: &ldquo;What
remains to be done is obvious to every human being&mdash;but to
the man who, instead of being a Methodist preacher, is, for the
ruin of Troy, and the misery of good old Priam and his sons,
become a legislator and a politician.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sydney
continues: &ldquo;I say, I fear he will ruin Ireland, and pursue
a line of policy destructive to the true interests of his
country: and then you tell me he is faithful to Mrs Perceval, and
kind to the Master Percevals!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally Peter warns his brother:&mdash;&ldquo;Mrs Abraham
Plymley, my sister, will be led away captive by an amorous Gaul;
and Joel Plymley, your first born, will be a French
drummer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I regret that I have not space to quote more from these
admirable <i>Letters</i>, which are full of good things.&nbsp; On
14th July 1807, he writes to Lady Holland <a
name="citation186"></a><a href="#footnote186"
class="citation">[186]</a>:&mdash;&ldquo;Mr Allen has mentioned
to me the letters of a Mr <!-- page 187--><a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>Plymley,
which I have obtained from the adjacent market-town, and read
with some entertainment.&nbsp; My conjecture lies between three
persons&mdash;Sir Samuel Romilly, Sir Arthur Pigott, or Mr
Horner, for the name is evidently fictitious.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
presume that Pigott was an eminently serious person to match the
other supposed authors.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeffrey</span>, 20<i>th Feb.</i>
1808.&mdash;&ldquo;Your Catholic article of the last Review is, I
perceive, printed separately.&nbsp; I am very glad of it: it is
excellent, and universally allowed to be so.&nbsp; I envy you
your sense, your style, and the good temper with which you attack
prejudices that drive me almost to the limits of
insanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He writes to Lady Holland in an early but undated letter (ii.,
p. 39) that he has let his house at Thames Ditton very well, and
sold to the tenant his wine and poultry!&mdash;&ldquo;I attribute
my success in these matters to having read half a volume of Adam
Smith early in the summer, and to hints that have dropped from
Horner, in his playful moods, upon the subject of sale and
barter.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Holland</span>, 1<i>st Nov.</i>
1809.&mdash;Speaking of his <!-- page 188--><a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>project of
publishing a pamphlet to be called Common Sense for 1810, he
concludes: &ldquo;But what use is there in all this, or in
anything else?&nbsp; Omnes ibimus ad Diabolum et Buonoparte nos
conquerabit, et dabit Hollandium Domum ad unum corporalium
suorum, et ponet ad mortem Joannem Allenium.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Holland</span>, <i>June</i>
1810.&mdash;&ldquo;You have done an excellent deed in securing a
seat for poor Mackintosh, in whose praise I most cordially
concur.&nbsp; He is a very great, and a very delightful man, and
with a few bad qualities added to his character, would have acted
a most conspicuous part in life.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Holland</span>, 17<i>th Jan.</i>
1813.&mdash;There had been meetings on the Catholic question, and
he says:&mdash;&ldquo;I shall certainly give my solitary voice in
favour of religious liberty, and shall probably be tossed in a
blanket for my pains.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John Allen</span>, 24<i>th Jan.</i>
1813.&mdash;&ldquo;My fancy is my own: I may see as many crosiers
in the clouds as I please; but when I sit down seriously to
consider what I shall do upon important occasions, I must presume
myself rector of Foston for life.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John Murray</span> [of Edinburgh], 12<i>th
July</i> 1813.&mdash;&ldquo;My situation is as follows:&mdash;I
am engaged in agriculture without the slightest knowledge of the
art; I am building a house without an architect, and educating a
son without patience. . . .&nbsp; My new mansion springs up
apace, and then I shall really have a pretty place to receive you
in, and a pleasant country to show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Holland</span>, 17<i>th Sept.</i>

fecundity of a <!-- page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span

kind dispositions justify me in letting you know that Mrs Sydney
and her new-born son are both extremely well.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John Allen</span>, 13<i>th Jan.</i>
1814.&mdash;Of Lord Holland, Sydney writes:&mdash;&ldquo;I wish
he would leave off wine entirely, after the manner of the Sharpe
and Rogers school.&nbsp; He is never guilty of excess; but there
is a certain respectable and dangerous plenitude, not quite
conducive to that state of health which all his friends most wish
to Lord Holland.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeffrey</span>, <i>Mar.</i>
1814.&mdash;&ldquo;Pray remember me, dear Jeffrey, and say a good
word for me if I die first.&nbsp; I shall say many for you in the
contrary event.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Holland</span>, 25<i>th June</i>
1814.&mdash;&ldquo;I liked London better than ever I liked it
before, and simply, I believe, from water-drinking.&nbsp; Without
this, London is stupefaction and inflammation.&nbsp; It is not
the love of wine, but thoughtlessness and unconscious
imitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeffrey</span>, 1814.&mdash;&ldquo;I like
my new house very much; . . . but the expense of it will keep me
a very poor man, a close prisoner here for my life, and render
the education of my children a difficult exertion for me.&nbsp;
My situation is one of great solitude, but I preserve myself in a
state of cheerfulness and tolerable content, and have a
propensity to amuse myself with trifles.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">F. Horner</span>, 1816.&mdash;Referring to
Dugald Stewart&rsquo;s <i>Preliminary Dissertations</i>, Sydney
says:&mdash;&ldquo;I was amazingly pleased with his comparison of
the Universities to enormous hulks confined with mooring-chains,
everything flowing and progressing around them.&nbsp; Nothing can
be more happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Holland</span>, 31<i>st July</i>
1817.&mdash;&ldquo;It is very <!-- page 190--><a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>curious to
consider in what manner Horner gained, in so extraordinary a
degree, the affections of such a number of persons of both
sexes&mdash;all ages, parties, and ranks in society; for he was
not remarkably good-tempered nor particularly lively and
agreeable; and an inflexible politician on the unpopular
side.&nbsp; The causes are, his high character for probity,
honour, and talents; his fine countenance; the benevolent
interest he took in the concerns of all his friends; his simple
and gentlemanlike manners; his untimely death.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Mary Bennett</span> (<i>n.d.</i>, but
late in 1817).&mdash;&ldquo;The few words I said of Mrs Fry . . .
were these:&mdash;&lsquo;To see that holy woman in the midst of
wretched prisoners,&mdash;to see them calling earnestly upon God,
soothed by her voice, animated by her look, clinging to the hem
of her garment, and worshipping her as the only human being who
has ever loved them . . . or spoken to them of God!&mdash;this is
the sight which breaks down the pageantry of the
world,&mdash;which tells us that the short hour of life is
passing away, and that we must prepare by some good deeds to meet
God; that it is time to give, to pray, to comfort&mdash;to go,
like this blessed woman, and do the work of our heavenly Saviour,
Jesus, among the guilty, among the broken-hearted, and the sick;
and to labour in the deepest and darkest wretchedness of
life!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<i>n.d.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Luttrell, before I taught him better,

<p><span class="smcap">Jeffrey</span>, 7<i>th Aug.</i>
1819.&mdash;There was universal complaint of the dullness of the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, <!-- page 191--><a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>and Sydney
writes: &ldquo;Too much, I admit, would not do of my style; but
the proportion in which it exists enlivens the Review, if you
appeal to the whole public, and not to the eight or ten grave
Scotchmen with whom you live.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Holland</span>, 11<i>th June</i>
1820.&mdash;&ldquo;You gave me great pleasure by what you said to
the Chancellor of my honesty and independence.&nbsp; I sincerely
believe I shall deserve the character at your hands as long as I
live.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Meynell</span>, 1820.&mdash;&ldquo;The
usual establishment for an eldest landed baby is, two wet nurses,
two ditto dry, two aunts, two physicians, two apothecaries; three
female friends of the family, unmarried, advanced in life; and
often in the nursery, one clergyman, six flatterers, and a
grandpapa!&nbsp; Less than this would not be decent.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Meynell</span>, 11<i>th Nov.</i>
1821.&mdash;&ldquo;My pretensions to do well with the world are
three-fold:&mdash;First, I am fond of talking nonsense; secondly,
I am civil; thirdly, I am brief.&nbsp; I may be flattering
myself; but if I am not, it is not easy to get very wrong with
these habits.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John Murray</span> [of Edinburgh], 29<i>th

Wedgwood!&nbsp; If he appears to love waltzing, it is only to
catch fresh figures for cream-jugs.&nbsp; Depend upon it, he will
have Jeffrey and you upon some of his vessels, and you will enjoy

1823.&mdash;&ldquo;I think you mistake Bond&rsquo;s character in

of a very independent mind, with whom pheasants at least, or
perhaps turkeys, are necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Holland</span>, 19<i>th Oct.</i>
1823.&mdash;&ldquo;All duchesses seem agreeable to clergymen; but
she would really be a very clever, agreeable woman, if she were

her.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Apparently the Duchess of Bedford.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Sydney</span>, 7<i>th May</i>

is very heedless of his own interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Holland</span>, <i>July</i>
1828.&mdash;&ldquo;I hear with great concern of your protracted

1828.&mdash;&ldquo;I not only was never better, but never half so
well: indeed I find I have been very ill all my life, without
knowing it.&nbsp; Let me state some of the goods arising from
abstaining from all fermented liquors.&nbsp; First, sweet sleep;
having never known what sweet sleep was, I sleep like a baby or a
ploughboy. . . .&nbsp; If I dream, it is not of lions and tigers,
but of Easter dues and tithes. . . .&nbsp; My understanding is
improved, and I comprehend Political Economy.&nbsp; I see better
without wine and spectacles than when I used both.&nbsp; Only one
evil ensues from it: I am in such extravagant spirits that I must
lose blood, or look out for some one who will bore and depress
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Holland</span>, <i>July</i>

class="pagenum">p. 199</span>CHARLES DICKENS</h2>
<p>My aim is to give some account of Charles Dickens&rsquo;
personality, to think of him as a man rather than a writer.&nbsp;
For the facts of his life I have to depend largely on
Forster&rsquo;s biography, <a name="citation199"></a><a
href="#footnote199" class="citation">[199]</a> which is doubtless
trustworthy, but the personality of the author does not tend to
make it attractive.&nbsp; In this way the little book by Miss M.
Dickens is valuable: it gives in simple and touching words an
impression of the affection that Dickens inspired.</p>
<p>She writes:&mdash;&ldquo;No man was so inclined naturally to
derive his happiness from home affairs.&nbsp; He was full of the
kind of interest in a house which is commonly confined to women,
and his care of and for us as wee children did most certainly
&lsquo;pass the love of women.&rsquo;&nbsp; His was a tender and
most affectionate nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he &ldquo;was arranging and rehearsing his readings from
<i>Dombey</i>, the death of &lsquo;little Paul&rsquo; caused him
such real anguish, that he told us he could only master his
intense emotion by keeping the picture of <!-- page 200--><a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>Plorn, <a
name="citation200a"></a><a href="#footnote200a"
class="citation">[200a]</a> well, strong, and hearty, steadily
before his eyes.&rdquo; <a name="citation200b"></a><a
href="#footnote200b" class="citation">[200b]</a></p>
<p>He took the children every 24th December to a toy-shop in
Holborn to choose their own Christmas presents and any that they
liked to give to their friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although I believe we were often an hour or more in the
shop before our several tastes were satisfied, he never showed
the least impatience, was always interested, and as desirous as
we, that we should choose exactly what we liked best. . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father insisted that my sister Katie and I should
teach the polka step to Mr Leech and himself, . . . often he
would practise gravely in a corner, without either partner or
music.&rdquo;&nbsp; He once got out of bed having waked with the
fear he had forgotten it, and rehearsed to his own whistling by
the light of a rushlight.</p>
<p>Miss Dickens continues:&mdash;&ldquo;There never existed, I
think, in all the world, a more thoroughly tidy or methodical
creature than was my father.&nbsp; He was tidy in every
way&mdash;in his mind, in his handsome and graceful person, in
his work, in keeping his writing, table drawers, in his large
correspondence&mdash;in fact in his whole life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then his punctuality!&nbsp; It was almost frightful
to an unpunctual mind.&nbsp; This again was another phase of his
extreme tidiness; it was also the outcome of his excessive
thoughtfulness and consideration for others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naturally enough Miss Dickens makes no reference to the
unhappy separation of Dickens and his wife, <!-- page 201--><a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>which took
place in 1858.&nbsp; In the article on Dickens in the
<i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>, Carlyle is quoted as
saying:&mdash;&ldquo;No crime and no misdemeanour specifiable on
either side; <i>unhappy</i> together, these two, good many years
past, and they at length end it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father of Charles Dickens was not a successful
personage.&nbsp; He was in the Navy Pay Office; he was generally
in financial trouble, and is indeed supposed to be the original
of Micawber.&nbsp; Like that personage he was imprisoned for
debt, and thus Charles Dickens learned early in life the misery
as well as the comedy of a debtor&rsquo;s prison, an experience
of which he made brilliant use in Little Dorrit and
elsewhere.</p>
<p>Forster points out that David Copperfield, who was in many
ways drawn from his creator, had as a man a strong memory of his
childhood; the most durable of his early impressions were
received at Chatham, and, as Forster remarks, &ldquo;the
associations that were around him when he died were those which
at the outset of his life had affected him most
strongly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an essay on travelling, Dickens <a
name="citation201"></a><a href="#footnote201"
class="citation">[201]</a> describes his meeting a &ldquo;very
queer small boy&rdquo; whom he takes in his carriage, and as they
pass Gads-hill Place (where Dickens afterwards lived and died)
the boy begs him to stop that they may look at the house.&nbsp;
On being asked whether he admired the house:&mdash;&ldquo;Bless
you, sir,&rdquo; said the very queer small boy, &ldquo;when I was
not more than half as old as nine, it used to be a treat for me
to be brought to look at it&mdash;And . . . my father, seeing me
so fond of it, has often said to me, <i>If you were to be very
persevering </i><!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span><i>and were to work hard</i>, <i>you
might some day come to live in it</i>.&nbsp; Though that&rsquo;s
impossible.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dickens was actually a queer small
boy&mdash;very small, very sickly, who was unable to join in the
active games of his schoolfellows.&nbsp; In 1855 we again meet
with the house that was to be his home for the remainder of his
life.&nbsp; He wrote to Wills (Letters, i. 393):&mdash;&ldquo;I
saw, at Gads Hill . . . a little freehold to be sold.&nbsp; The
spot and the very house are literally &lsquo;a dream of my
childhood,&rsquo; and I should like to look at it before I go to
Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the many things in <i>David Copperfield</i> which are
autobiographical is the account <a name="citation202a"></a><a
href="#footnote202a" class="citation">[202a]</a> of his delight
over his father&rsquo;s little collection of books.&nbsp;
&ldquo;From that blessed little room, <i>Roderick Random</i>,
<i>Peregrine Pickle</i>, <i>Humphrey Clinker</i>, <i>Tom
Jones</i>, <i>the Vicar of Wakefield</i>, <i>Don Quixote</i>,
<i>Gil Blas</i>, and <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> <a
name="citation202b"></a><a href="#footnote202b"
class="citation">[202b]</a> came out, a glorious host, to keep me
company.&nbsp; They kept alive my fancy, and my hope of something
beyond that place and time&mdash;they, and the <i>Arabian
Nights</i>, and the <i>Tales of the Genii</i>&mdash;and did me no
harm. . . .&nbsp; I have been Tom <!-- page 203--><a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>Jones (a
child&rsquo;s Tom Jones, a harmless creature) for a week
together. . . .&nbsp; I had a greedy relish for a few volumes of
voyages and travels . . . . and for days and days I can remember
to have gone about my region of our house, armed with the
centre-piece out of an old set of boot-trees: the perfect
realisation of Captain Somebody of the Royal British
Navy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a time they moved to London, where they lived poorly in
what was then a wretched enough neighbourhood, Bayham St.,
Camden-town.&nbsp; There he degenerated into a neglected domestic
drudge, apparently quite without education, a state of things he
inwardly resented.</p>
<p>In reading George Colman&rsquo;s <i>Broad Grins</i> he came
upon a description of Covent Garden, and &ldquo;stole to the
market by himself to compare it with the book.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
remembered Covent Garden in writing <i>Pickwick</i>.&nbsp; In
chap. xlvii., Job Trotter is sent in the evening to tell Perker
that Dodson and Fogg have taken Mrs Bardell in execution for her
costs.&nbsp; Perker goes back to his dinner guests, and poor Job
has to spend the night in a vegetable basket in Covent
Garden.</p>
<p>Dickens the elder was arrested for debt and imprisoned in the
Marshalsea, and the description of borrowing Captain
Porter&rsquo;s knife and fork, and his thinking that he should
not like to borrow that gentleman&rsquo;s comb, were written
before he ever thought of David Copperfield. <a
name="citation203"></a><a href="#footnote203"
class="citation">[203]</a>&nbsp; There is, of course, much that
is autobiographical in <i>David Copperfield</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For, the poor little lad, with good ability and a most
<!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>sensitive nature, turned at the age of ten into a
&lsquo;labouring hind&rsquo; in the service of Murdstone and
Grinby&rdquo; . . . was indeed himself.&nbsp; Dickens described
in an autobiographical fragment the details of the mechanical
work of covering the pots of paste-blacking.&nbsp; It is
interesting to find Dickens making use in <i>Oliver Twist</i> of
the name Fagin, who was one of his fellow pasters.&nbsp; Another
boy was Poll Green, part of whose name appears in that of the
celebrated Mr Sweelepipe in <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>.&nbsp;
Another of his characters is connected with this period, for
during his father&rsquo;s imprisonment the boy lodged with an old
lady subsequently immortalised as Mrs Pipchin.&nbsp; Afterwards
he remonstrated with his father with many tears, and a lodging
was found for him in Lant Street in the Borough as being nearer
to the prison, and here it was that Bob Sawyer lodged.&nbsp; The
little maid who waited on his father and mother in the Marshalsea
was the model for the Marchioness in the <i>Old Curiosity
Shop</i> (Forster, i., p. 39).&nbsp; After a time his father came
out of prison, and Charles the younger got some schooling at
Wellington House Academy, which supplied &ldquo;some of the
lighter traits of Salem-house&rdquo; in <i>David
Copperfield</i>.</p>
<p>Dickens began life as a lawyer&rsquo;s clerk of a humble sort,
and thus gained the knowledge of which he made such admirable use
in <i>Pickwick</i> and elsewhere.</p>
<p>But his energy in learning shorthand and becoming a
professional reporter at the age of nineteen was a much more
important step.&nbsp; Forster quotes Beard, &ldquo;the friend he
first made in that line when he <!-- page 205--><a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>entered the
gallery,&rdquo; as saying that &ldquo;there never was such a
reporter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dickens saw the last of the old coaching days, and he
describes his experience as a reporter&mdash;work which largely
contributed to his literary success:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had to charge for half a dozen breakdowns in
half a dozen times as many miles.&nbsp; Also for the damage of a
great-coat from the drippings of a blazing wax-candle, in writing
through the smallest hours of the night in a swiftly flying
carriage and pair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been . . . belated on miry by-roads, towards the
small hours, forty or fifty miles from London, in a wheel-less
carriage with exhausted horses and drunken post-boys, and have
got back in time for publication, to be received with
never-forgotten compliments by the late Mr Black . . . in the
broadest of Scotch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We see plainly enough whence came the description <a
name="citation205"></a><a href="#footnote205"
class="citation">[205]</a> of the chase after Jingle and Miss
Wardle.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;I see his head,&rsquo; exclaimed the
choleric old man, &lsquo;Damme, I see his head. . . &lsquo;&nbsp;
The countenance of Mr Jingle, completely coated with mud thrown
up by the wheels, was plainly discernible at the window of his
chaise, and the motion of his arm, which he was waving violently
towards the postillions, denoted that he was encouraging them to
increased exertion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never did feel such a jolting in my life,&rdquo; said
poor Mr Pickwick; but it was under such conditions that Dickens
worked through the nights transcribing his shorthand notes.</p>
<p><!-- page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>While he was still a reporter his career as an author
began.</p>
<p>In a letter to Wilkie Collins, 6th June 1856, Dickens relates
that he began &ldquo;to write fugitive pieces for the old
<i>Monthly Magazine</i>&rdquo; when he was in &ldquo;the
gallery&rdquo; for the <i>Mirror of Parliament</i>.&nbsp; His
<i>op. 1</i> was <i>Mrs Joseph Porter over the Way</i>; and when
it appeared in the glory of print &ldquo;I walked down,&rdquo; he
wrote, &ldquo;to Westminster Hall and turned into it for half an
hour, because my eyes were so dimmed with joy and pride that they
could not bear the street, and were not fit to be
seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was followed by several other articles in the <i>Monthly
Magazine</i>, the last in February 1835 was the first to bear the
immortal signature of Boz, <a name="citation206"></a><a
href="#footnote206" class="citation">[206]</a> and in 1836 the
series of <i>Sketches by Boz</i> was published.</p>
<p>In the same year, 1836, a notice appeared in the <i>Times</i>
of 26th March &ldquo;that on the 31st would be published the
first shilling number of the <i>Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick
Club</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The original plan had been to make
Pickwick an essentially sporting book, but to this Dickens
demurred on account of his ignorance of such matters, and poor Mr
Winkle remains as a sacrifice to the idea.</p>
<p>It is curious how important the illustrations of his books
seemed to Dickens; there are constant references to the subject
in his <i>Letters</i>, nor does he seem to have been generally
satisfied.</p>
<p>Illustrations in fiction are in my judgment only tolerable
when a book is read for the first time in <!-- page 207--><a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>an
illustrated edition, <i>e.g.</i> Du Maurier&rsquo;s
<i>Trilby</i>.&nbsp; But when a reader has formed his own idea of
a character, those of the artist jar on preconceived
impressions.&nbsp; Seymour was selected to illustrate
<i>Pickwick</i>, but he committed suicide between the appearance
of the first and second numbers; then a single number was
illustrated by Mr Buss; and finally Hablot Browne was selected,
and he was, in Forster&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;not unworthily
associated with the masterpieces of Dickens&rsquo;
genius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Personally I feel nothing but astonishment that the
illustrations should have been liked by anybody.&nbsp; Dickens
was, however, saved from a worse fate&mdash;that of being
illustrated by Thackeray, who, in speaking of Dickens at a Royal
Academy dinner, said, &ldquo;I recollect walking up to his
chambers in Furnival&rsquo;s Inn with two or three drawings in my
hand, which strange to say, he did not find suitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forster&rsquo;s chapter on the writing of <i>Pickwick</i>
contains some personal recollections of the author which may find
a place here.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very different was his face in those
days, <i>circa</i> 1837, from that which photography has made
familiar to the present generation.&nbsp; A look of youthfulness
first attracted you, and then a candour and openness of
expression which made you sure of the qualities within.&nbsp; The
features were very good.&nbsp; He had a capital forehead . . .
eyes wonderfully beaming with intellect and running over with
humour and cheerfulness, and a rather prominent mouth strongly
marked with sensibility.&rdquo;&nbsp; He speaks, too, of the
beardless face and rich brown hair in &ldquo;most luxuriant
abundance.&rdquo;&nbsp; What remained to <!-- page 208--><a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>the last
was the expression of &ldquo;keenness and practical power,&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;eager, restless, energetic outlook&rdquo; which
suggested a man of action rather than a writer of books.&nbsp;
Leigh Hunt said of it, &ldquo;What a face . . . to meet in a
drawing-room! . . .&nbsp; It had the life and soul in it of fifty
human beings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A touching proof of Dickens&rsquo; sensibility is given by the
fact that the writing of <i>Pickwick</i> was interrupted for two
months by the death of his wife&rsquo;s younger sister Mary.</p>
<p>The <i>Quarterly Review</i>, Oct. 1837, referring to the fact
that <i>Pickwick</i> and <i>Oliver Twist</i> were appearing at
the same time, said, &ldquo;Indications are not wanting that the
particular vein of humour which has hitherto yielded so much
attractive metal, is worked out. . . .&nbsp; The fact is, Mr
Dickens writes too often and too fast. . . .&nbsp; If he persists
much longer in this course it requires no gift of prophecy to
foretell his fate&mdash;he has risen like a rocket, and he will
come down like the stick&rdquo;&mdash;a singularly incorrect
prediction.</p>
<p>The success of <i>Pickwick</i> <a name="citation208"></a><a
href="#footnote208" class="citation">[208]</a> was enormous, but
the profits reaped by the author can hardly share in that
adjective.&nbsp; There was no agreement about its publication,
except a verbal one.&nbsp; For each number Dickens was to receive
fifteen guineas, and the publishers paid him at once for the
first two numbers &ldquo;as he required the money to go and get
married with.&rdquo;&nbsp; Besides <!-- page 209--><a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>these
payments he seems at the time to have received only
&pound;2500.&nbsp; In 1839 Dickens wrote to Forster of &ldquo;the
immense profits which <i>Oliver</i> has realised to its
publisher, and is still realising,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the paltry,
wretched sum it brought to me.&rdquo; . . .</p>
<p>His friends made an important part of Dickens&rsquo;
life.&nbsp; One of the earliest was Macready, <a
name="citation209"></a><a href="#footnote209"
class="citation">[209]</a> the actor, to whom he first wrote
apparently in 1837, inviting him to a Pickwick dinner.&nbsp; He
here addresses him as &ldquo;My dear Sir,&rdquo; but in 1838 he
becomes &ldquo;My dear Macready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In that year Dickens wrote a farce for Macready, <!-- page
210--><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>which, however, had to be withdrawn, and its author
wrote characteristically, &ldquo;Believe me that I have no other
feeling of disappointment . . . but that arising from the not
having been able to be of use to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Macready
remained a close friend as long as he lived, and Dickens does not
seem to have suffered from the churlishness referred to in the
<i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>.</p>
<p>In 1851 Macready appeared on the stage for the last time in
public.&nbsp; Dickens wrote (27th Feb. 1851):&mdash;&ldquo;No
light portion of my life arose before me when the quiet vision to
which I am beholden, in I don&rsquo;t know how great a degree, or
for how much&mdash;who does?&mdash;faded so nobly from my bodily
eyes last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There must have been a certain innocence in Macready or the
following letter (May 24, 1851) would not have been appropriate:
&ldquo;Always go into some respectable shop or apply to a
policeman.&nbsp; You will know him by his being dressed in blue,
with very dull silver buttons, and by the top of his hat being
made of sticking plaster. . . .&nbsp; I would recommend you to
see X at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.&nbsp; Anybody will show
it to you.&nbsp; It is near the Strand, and you may know it by
seeing no company whatever at any of the doors.&nbsp; Cab fares
are eighteen-pence a mile.&nbsp; A mile London measure is half a
Dorsetshire mile, recollect.&nbsp; Porter is two pence per pint.
. . .&nbsp; The Zoological Gardens are in the Regent&rsquo;s Park
and the price of admission is one shilling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another artist who became a close friend of <!-- page 211--><a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>Dickens was
Stanfield, of whom we first hear as making one of a trip to
Cornwall in 1842.&nbsp; His friendship with Cattermole, the
painter, began in 1839 and suffered no diminution.&nbsp; His
early letters to this correspondent are on the illustrations for
the <i>Old Curiosity Shop</i>, where we find minute instruction
about the drawing of Mrs Jarley&rsquo;s Wax Work cart and other
detailed points.</p>
<p>Dickens speaks of being nearly dead with grief at the loss of
little Nell.&nbsp; He says he looks at Cattermole&rsquo;s
beautiful illustrations with a pleasure he cannot describe in
words.</p>
<p>He seems, too, to have been in 1840 on familiar terms with
Daniel Maclise.&nbsp; Only two letters to this friend exist, whom
Miss Dickens describes as a &ldquo;much-loved friend and most
intimate companion&rdquo; of her father.</p>
<p>In January 1842 Dickens started for America, and on 31st
January he writes&mdash;&ldquo;I can give you no conception of my
welcome here.&nbsp; There never was a king or emperor upon the
earth so cheered and followed by crowds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reference to Miss Martineau meets with showers of abuse.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She told us of some of our faults, and Americans
can&rsquo;t bear to be told of their faults.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In respect of not being left alone, and of being
horribly disgusted by tobacco-chewing and tobacco spittle, I have
suffered considerably&rdquo; (i., p. 67).</p>
<p>&ldquo;In every town where we stay, though it be only for a
day, we hold a regular lev&eacute;e or drawing-room, where I
shake hands on an average with five or six hundred people. .
.&nbsp; Think of two hours of this <!-- page 212--><a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>every day,
and the people coming by hundreds, all fresh, and piping hot, and
full of questions, when we are literally exhausted and can hardly
stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the few entirely satisfactory occurrences was the gift
of a dog called Boz, who was re-named Mr Snittle Timbery after a
character in <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>.&nbsp; He lived to be very
old and went everywhere with his master (i., p. 70,
<i>note</i>).</p>
<p>At Niagara he got some peace, which was much needed because of
&ldquo;the incessant persecutions of the people, by land and
water, on stage-coach, railway car, and steamer, which exceeds
anything you can picture to yourself by the utmost stretch of
your imagination&rdquo; (i., p. 71).</p>
<p>And on the copyright scandal he writes in the same letter:
&ldquo;Is it not a horrible thing that scoundrel book-sellers
should grow rich here from publishing books, the authors of which
do not reap one farthing from their issue by scores of thousands;
and that every vile blackguard, and detestable newspaper, so
filthy and bestial that no honest man would admit one into his
house for a scullery door-mat, should be able to publish these
same writings, side by side, cheek by jowl, with the coarsest and
most obscene companions?&rdquo;&nbsp; Not that he had much hope
of reform, but he could not help crying, &ldquo;<i>Stop</i>,
<i>thief</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On his return he wrote to Longman: &ldquo;I have fought the
fight across the Atlantic with the utmost energy I could command;
have never been turned aside by any consideration for an instant;
am fresher for the fray than ever; will battle it to death, and
<!-- page 213--><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>die game to the last.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was soon
entangled in dinners; of his trials at a hospital dinner he wrote
of listening to speeches and sentiments such &ldquo;as any
moderately intelligent dustman&rdquo; would have blushed to have
thought of.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sleek, slobbering, bow-paunched,
over-fed, apoplectic, snorting cattle, and the auditory leaping
up in their delight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In November 1843, he speaks of an opera he did in
&ldquo;damnable good nature for Hullah,&rdquo; who wrote
&ldquo;some very pretty music to it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also did a
farce &ldquo;as a sort of practical joke.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It
was funny&mdash;adapted from one of the published sketches called
the &lsquo;Great Winglebury Duel,&rsquo; and was published by
Chapman and Hall.&rdquo;&nbsp; He devoutly wished these
productions forgotten.</p>
<p>In a letter to Macready of 3rd January 1844, he speaks of
sending him a little book which had been published 17th December
1843, and describes it as the greatest success, &ldquo;I think, I
have ever achieved.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seems to be the <i>Christmas
Carol</i>, as on 4th January 1844 he wrote to Leman Blanchard in
regard to a review of the <i>Carol</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
<i>must</i> thank you because you have filled my heart up to the
brim, and it is running over.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the summer of 1844
he started for a holiday abroad, but in November he travelled
back to London to see <i>The Chimes</i> through the press, of
which he wrote, 5th November 1844:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I have . . . knocked the <i>Carol</i> out of
the field.&nbsp; It will make a great uproar, I have no
doubt.&rdquo;&nbsp; He adds (i., p. 145): &ldquo;If you had seen
Macready, last night, undisguisedly sobbing and crying on the
sofa as I read <i>The Chimes</i>, you would <!-- page 214--><a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>have felt,
as I did, what a thing it is to have power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1845 we hear of private theatricals for the first time,
when Dickens writes to Cattermole about taking a part in <i>Every
Man in his Humour</i>.&nbsp; On a similar occasion in 1850 a
master carpenter from one of the theatres said, &ldquo;Ah, sir,
it&rsquo;s a universal observation in the profession, sir, that
it was a great loss to the public when you took to writing
books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1847 we hear of more acting, <i>Every Man in his Humour</i>
being given again for the benefit of Leigh Hunt, with the help of
George Cruickshank, George Henry Lewes, and Augustus Egg, as new
members of the Company (i., p. 177).</p>
<p>In 1846 he gave up all connection with the <i>Daily News</i>,
which he had rashly agreed to edit.&nbsp; He went to Switzerland,
taking a villa (Rosemount) there, from May till November.&nbsp;
Here he wrote <i>The Battle of Life</i> and began
<i>Dombey</i>.&nbsp; It was here that he made friends of M. de
Cerjat, Mr Haldimand, and of Hon. Richard and Mrs Watson of
Rockingham Castle, to whom he afterwards dedicated his favourite
book, <i>David Copperfield</i>.</p>
<p>It was at this time, too, that was founded his friendship with
W. H. Wills, who became an assistant in editing <i>All the Year
Round</i>, and in other ways.</p>
<p>In March 1846 he wrote to Wills:&mdash;&ldquo;Tell Powell . .
. that he needn&rsquo;t &lsquo;deal with&rsquo; the American
notices of the <i>Cricket</i>.&nbsp; I never read one word of
their abuse, and I should think it base to read their
praises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wrote, 27th November 1846, to Mr Watson (from
Paris):&mdash;&ldquo;We are lodged at last in the most <!-- page
215--><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>preposterous house in the world. . . .&nbsp; The
bedrooms are like opera-boxes.&nbsp; The dining-rooms,
stair-cases, and passages, quite inexplicable. . . .&nbsp; There
is a gleam of reason in the drawing-room.&nbsp; But it is
approached through a series of small chambers, like the joints of
a telescope, which are hung with inscrutable drapery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later impressions of Paris (1855&ndash;56) may find a place
here.&nbsp; &ldquo;A man who brought some little vases home last
night said, &lsquo;On connait bien en France, que Monsieur
Dick-in prend sa position sur la dignit&eacute; de la
litt&eacute;rature.&nbsp; Ah! c&rsquo;est grande chose!&nbsp; Et
ces caract&egrave;res sont si spirituellement
tourn&eacute;es!&nbsp; Cette Madame Tojare (Todgers), ah!
qu&rsquo;elle est dr&ocirc;le et pr&eacute;cis&eacute;ment comme
une dame que je connais &agrave; Calais.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the winter of 1856 he wrote:&mdash;&ldquo;I met Madame
Georges Sands the other day at a dinner got up by Madame Viardot.
. . .&nbsp; The human mind cannot conceive anyone more
astonishing opposed to all my preconceptions.&nbsp; If I had been
shown her in a state of repose, and asked what I thought her to
be, I should have said: &lsquo;The Queen&rsquo;s monthly
nurse.&rsquo;&nbsp; <i>Au reste</i>, she has nothing of the
<i>bas bleu</i> about her, and is very quiet and
agreeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On 20th May 1855, he wrote to Stanfield about the scenery of a
play by Wilkie Collins which was in preparation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is only one scene in the piece, and that, my
tarry lad, is the inside of a light-house.&nbsp; Will you come
and paint it for us one night, and we&rsquo;ll all turn to and
help.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again to the same friend (22nd May 1855):
&ldquo;The great ambition of my life <!-- page 216--><a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>will be
achieved at last, in the wearing of a pair of very coarse
petticoat trousers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wrote to Stanfield about the performance&mdash;&ldquo;Lemon
and I did every conceivable absurdity, I think, in the farce; and
they never left off laughing. . . .&nbsp; Then Scotch reels till
5 A.M.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dickens could appreciate other actors, and he writes in 1862
of Fechter&rsquo;s Hamlet as a &ldquo;performance of
extraordinary merit; by far the most coherent, consistent, and
intelligible Hamlet I ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the same subject he wrote to Macready: &ldquo;Fechter doing
wonders over the way here, with a picturesque French drama.&nbsp;
Miss Kate Terry, in a small part in it, perfectly charming. . .
.&nbsp; She has a tender love-scene in this piece, which is a
really beautiful and artistic thing. . . .&nbsp; I told Fechter:
&lsquo;That this is the very best piece of womanly tenderness I
have ever seen on the stage, and you&rsquo;ll find that no
audience can miss it.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation216"></a><a
href="#footnote216" class="citation">[216]</a></p>
<p><i>Dombey</i> was published early in 1848, and during the
whole of 1849 and the summer and autumn of 1850 he was writing
<i>David Copperfield</i>.&nbsp; In Sir Walter Raleigh&rsquo;s
<i>Shakespeare</i>, 1907, p. 31, it is suggested that &ldquo;if
the father of Charles Dickens lent his likeness to Mr Micawber,
it is at least possible that some not unkindly memories of the
paternal advice of John Shakespeare have been preserved for us in
the sage maxims of Polonius.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>In March 1852 the first number of <i>Bleak House</i>
appeared, and he wrote to Mary Boyle, 22nd July
1852:&mdash;&ldquo;I am not quite sure that I ever did like, or
ever shall like, anything quite so well as
<i>Copperfield</i>.&nbsp; But I foresee, I think, some very good
things in <i>Bleak House</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; In November he records
that the sale is half as large again as <i>Copperfield</i>.&nbsp;
In the winter of 1850 he showed his appreciation of Mrs Gaskell
by writing to her (31st January 1850): &ldquo;I do honestly know
that there is no living English writer whose aid I would desire
to enlist in preference to the authoress of <i>Mary Barton</i> (a
book that most profoundly affected and impressed me).&rdquo; . .
. .</p>
<p>In September 1857, he writes to Miss Hogarth from Allonby,
telling her of the homage he receives in the
North&mdash;station-masters help him to alight, deputations await
him at hotels, crowds see him off.&nbsp; The landlady at Allonby
was immensely fat, and her husband said that once on a time he
could tuck his arm round her waist.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;And
can&rsquo;t you do it now,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;you insensible
dog?&nbsp; Look at me!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a picture!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Accordingly, I got round as much of her as I could; and this
gallant action was the most successful I have ever performed, on
the whole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1853 he took the Ch&acirc;teau des Moulineaux at Boulogne,
whence he wrote asking a friend to visit him.&nbsp; He described
his ch&acirc;teau:&mdash;&ldquo;Excellent light wines on the
premises, French cookery, millions of roses, two cows (for milk
punch), vegetables cut for the pot, and handed in at the kitchen
window; five summer-houses, fifteen fountains (with no water in
<!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>&rsquo;em), and thirty-seven clocks (keeping, as I
conceive, Australian time).&rdquo;</p>
<p>In September of the same year (1853) he writes to Walter
Savage Landor:&mdash;&ldquo;I may now write to thank you for the
happiness you have given me by honouring my name with such
generous mention on (? in) such a noble place, in your great
book. . . .&nbsp; Believe me, I receive the dedication like a
great dignity, the worth of which I hope I thoroughly
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this year, too, he gave his first public readings, which
took place at Birmingham, and well would it have been for him had
he never embarked on this exhausting occupation.&nbsp; He
describes his reading:&mdash;&ldquo;A vast intelligent
assemblage, and the success was most wonderful and
prodigious&mdash;perfectly overwhelming and astounding
altogether.&rdquo;&nbsp; No wonder that he was tempted to
continue such a triumph!&nbsp; A passage in a letter to Cerjat
shows how celebrated he already was:&mdash;&ldquo;He embarked at
Calais for Dover, and the &lsquo;Fact of distinguished
Author&rsquo;s being abroad, was telegraphed to Dover; thereupon
authorities of Dover Railway detained train to London for
distinguished author&rsquo;s arrival, rather to the exasperation
of British public.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In November 1854 he speaks of being &ldquo;used up&rdquo;
after writing <i>Hard Times</i>.&nbsp; He had intended to take a
long rest, &ldquo;when the idea [of that book] laid hold of me by
the throat, in a very violent manner, and because the compression
and close condensation necessary for that disjointed form of
publication gave me perpetual trouble.&nbsp; But I really was
tired, which is a result so very incomprehensible that I
can&rsquo;t forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 219--><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>Dickens took pains with his style even in his letters,
and it gives one a shock to find him writing that Adelaide
Proctor &ldquo;<i>don&rsquo;t</i> live at the place to which her
letters are addressed,&rdquo; where I should write
&ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1855 he began <i>Little Dorrit</i> in Paris, a book he
originally christened <i>Nobody&rsquo;s Fault</i>, and the change
was certainly a wise one.</p>
<p>In this year we find him assisting at the birth of an
admirable book:&mdash;&ldquo;Sydney Smith&rsquo;s daughter <a
name="citation219"></a><a href="#footnote219"
class="citation">[219]</a> has privately printed the life of her
father with selections from his letters, which has great merit
and often presents him exactly as he used to be.&nbsp; I have
strongly urged her to publish it&rdquo; (i., p. 390).</p>
<p>In planning his public readings about this time, he writes
(29th January 1855, in regard to <i>David
Copperfield</i>):&mdash;&ldquo;I never can approach the book with
perfect composure (it had such perfect possession of me when I
wrote it).&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the many instances of his scrupulous honesty is his
refusal of an invitation to a Lord Mayor&rsquo;s dinner.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I do not think it consistent with my respect for myself,
or for the art I profess, to blow hot and cold in the same
breath; and to laugh at an institution in print, and accept the
hospitality of its representative while the ink is staring us all
in the face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In returning from reading at Sheffield, &ldquo;a tremendous
success,&rdquo; he describes his experiences: &ldquo;At two or
three o&rsquo;clock in the morning I stopped at Peterboro&rsquo;
again, and thought of you all disconsolately.&nbsp; The lady in
the refreshment-room was very hard upon me, harder even than
those fair enslavers usually are.&nbsp; <!-- page 220--><a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>She gave me
a cup of tea, as if I were a hyena and she my cruel keeper with a
strong dislike to me.&nbsp; I mingled my tears with it, and had a
petrified bun of enormous antiquity in miserable
meekness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Court of Chancery finds a place in more than one of his
books.&nbsp; His strong feeling in regard to it is shown in the
following extract from a letter to Wills: &ldquo;It has become
(through the vile dealing with those courts and the vermin they
have called into existence) a positive precept of experience,
that a man had better endure a great wrong than go, or suffer
himself to be taken, into Chancery, with the dream of setting it
right&rdquo; (7th August 1856).</p>
<p>He wrote to Mrs Winter: &ldquo;A necessity is upon me . . . of
wandering about in my old wild way, to think.&nbsp; I could no
more resist this on Sunday or yesterday than a man can dispense
with food. . . .&nbsp; Whoever is devoted to an art must be
content to deliver himself wholly up to it, and find his
recompense in it.&nbsp; I am grieved if you suspect me of not
wanting to see you, but I can&rsquo;t help it; I must go my way
whether or no&rdquo; (3rd April 1855).</p>
<p>In September 1855 he was at Folkestone, whence he wrote to Mrs
Watson about <i>Little Dorrit</i>, to which he at the time
intended to give the name <i>Nobody&rsquo;s Fault</i>: &ldquo;The
new story is everywhere&mdash;heaving in the sea, flying with the
clouds, blowing in the wind. . . .&nbsp; I settle to nothing, and
wonder (in the old way) at my own incomprehensibility&rdquo;
(16th September 1855).</p>
<p>In 1857 he came into possession of Gad&rsquo;s Hill, and thus
fulfilled the dream of his childhood.</p>
<p><!-- page 221--><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>There are many instances of his kindness to would-be
authors.&nbsp; In a letter to a lady he says that he cannot tell
her with what reluctance he gives an opinion against her story,
in spite of much that is good in it.&nbsp; And about an article
by another lady he writes to F. Stone (who approached Dickens on
her behalf).&nbsp; He says: &ldquo;These Notes are destroyed by
too much smartness.&nbsp; For the love of God don&rsquo;t
condescend!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t assume the attitude of saying,
&lsquo;See how clever I am, and what fun everybody else
is.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a letter to Miss Hogarth from Dublin he wrote: &ldquo;The
success at Belfast has been equal to the success here.&nbsp;
Enormous! . . . and the personal affection there was something
overwhelming. . . .&nbsp; I have never seen men go in to cry
undisguisedly as they did at that reading yesterday
afternoon.&nbsp; They made no attempt whatever to hide it, and
certainly cried more than the women.&nbsp; As to the
&lsquo;Boots&rsquo; [at the Holly Tree Inn] at night, and
&lsquo;Mrs Gamp&rsquo; too, it was just one roar with me and
them, for they made me laugh so that sometimes <i>I could not</i>
compose my face to go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With regard to the crowds at his readings he wrote to Miss
Dickens: &ldquo;Arthur <a name="citation221"></a><a
href="#footnote221" class="citation">[221]</a> told you, I
suppose, that he had his shirt-front and waistcoat torn off last
night.&nbsp; He was perfectly enraptured in consequence.&nbsp;
Our men got so knocked about that he gave them five shillings
apiece on the spot.&nbsp; John passed several minutes upside
against a wall, with his head among the people&rsquo;s
boots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We hear of his readings in a letter to John Forster: &ldquo;I
cannot tell you what the demonstrations of personal <!-- page
222--><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>regard and respect are; how the densest and most
uncomfortably packed crowd will be hushed in an instant when I
show my face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again to the same friend:&mdash;&ldquo;At Aberdeen we were
crammed to the street twice every day. . .&nbsp; And at the end
of <i>Dombey</i> yesterday afternoon at Perth, in the cold light
of day, they all got up . . . and thundered and waved their hats
with that astonishing heartiness and fondness for me . . . that
they took me completely off my legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsewhere he speaks of being overwhelmed with proposals to
read in America, and adds, &ldquo;Will never go, unless a small
fortune be first paid down in money on this side of the
Atlantic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the autumn he writes to Regnier, enclosing proofs of <i>A
Tale of Two Cities</i>: &ldquo;I want you to read it for two
reasons.&nbsp; Firstly, because I hope it is the best story I
have written.&nbsp; Secondly, because it treats of a very
remarkable time in France; and I should very much like to know
what you think of its being dramatised for a French theatre. . .
.&nbsp; The story is an extraordinary success here&rdquo; (15th
Oct. 1859).</p>
<p>He felt strongly about public executions.&nbsp; Forster
describes how Dickens saw the hanging of the Mannings, and says
that &ldquo;with the letter which Dickens wrote next day to the
<i>Times</i> descriptive of what we had witnessed on that
memorable morning, there began an active agitation against public
executions,&rdquo; which was finally successful.&nbsp; But in
1860 the evil still existed; he wrote, 4th September 1860, to W.
H. Wills: &ldquo;Coming here from the station this morning, I
met, coming from the <!-- page 223--><a name="page223"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>execution of the Wentworth murderer,
such a tide of ruffians as never could have flowed from any point
but the gallows.&nbsp; Without any figure of speech it turned one
white and sick to behold them&rdquo; (4th Sept. 1860).</p>
<p>In December he wrote:&mdash;&ldquo;Pray read <i>Great
Expectations</i>.&nbsp; I think it is very droll.&nbsp; It is a
very great success, and seems universally liked&mdash;I suppose
because it opens funnily, and with an interest too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In July 1861 he writes to Forster, telling him that he has
altered the end of <i>Great Expectations</i>.&nbsp; This was done
at the suggestion of Bulwer Lytton, who objected to Pip being
left &ldquo;a solitary man.&rdquo;&nbsp; The curious may read the
original ending in Forster&rsquo;s <i>Life</i>, vol. iv., p.
336.</p>
<p>We meet many instances of Dickens&rsquo; sensitiveness to the
character of his audience.&nbsp; Thus he writes:&mdash;&ldquo;I
could have done perfectly if the audience had been bright, but
they were an intent and staring audience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An excellent house to-night, and an audience positively
perfect . . . an intelligent and delightful response in them,
like the touch of a beautiful instrument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He showed presence of mind, too, on an occasion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The gas batten came down and it looked as if the room were
falling.&nbsp; A lady in front row of stalls screamed and ran out
wildly.&nbsp; He addressed her laughing, and saying &lsquo;no
danger,&rsquo; and she sat down to a thunder of
applause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I like his references to his children.&nbsp; He writes:
&ldquo;Why a boy of that age should seem to have on <!-- page
224--><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>at
all times a hundred and fifty pair of double-soled boots, and be
always jumping a bottom stair with the whole hundred and fifty, I
don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you give my small Admiral, on his personal
application, one sovereign?&nbsp; I have told him to come to you
for that recognition of his meritorious services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to Miss Boyle: &ldquo;The little Admiral has gone to visit
America in the <i>Orlando</i> . . . he went away much gamer than
any giant, attented by a chest in which he could easily have
stowed himself and a wife and family of his own
proportions&rdquo; (28th Dec. 1861).</p>
<p>Dogs were to Dickens almost as dear as children.&nbsp; In 1863
he writes to Percy Fitzgerald like a flattered parent: &ldquo;I
have been most heartily gratified by the perusal of your article
on my dogs.&nbsp; It has given me an amount and a kind of
pleasure very unusual, and for which I thank you earnestly. . .
.&nbsp; I should be delighted to see you here. . . .&nbsp; I and
my two latest dogs, a St Bernard and a bloodhound, would be
charmed with your company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Boulogne, in 1856, he received a present of &ldquo;the
nicest of little dogs,&rdquo; which its master, a cobbler, could
not afford to pay tax for.&nbsp; The dog escaped and got killed,
and &ldquo;I must lie to him&mdash;the cobbler&mdash;for life,
and say that the dog is fat and happy&rdquo; (ii., p. 58).</p>
<p>In the winter of 1862 he was reading at Cheltenham.&nbsp;
Macready was in the audience, and Dickens writes: &ldquo;I found
him quite unable to speak, and able to do nothing but square his
dear old jaw all <!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>on one side, and roll his eyes (half
closed), like Jackson&rsquo;s picture of him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Macready said: &ldquo;I swear to heaven that, as a piece of
passion and playfulness&mdash;er&mdash;indescribably mixed up
together, it does&mdash;er&mdash;no, really, Dickens! amaze me as
profoundly as it moves me. . . .&nbsp; How is it got
at&mdash;er&mdash;how is it done&mdash;er&mdash;how one man
can&mdash;well?&nbsp; It lays me on my&mdash;er&mdash;back, and
it is of no use talking about it!&rdquo; (ii., p. 196).</p>
<p>Dickens seems to have been thought to have done a wrong to
Jews in general by his character Fagin in <i>Oliver
Twist</i>.&nbsp; He wrote, 10th July 1863, to a Jewish lady that
it &ldquo;unfortunately was true of the time to which the story
refers, that that class of criminal almost invariably was a
Jew.&rdquo;&nbsp; The real reply to her letter was Riah in <i>Our
Mutual Friend</i>.</p>
<p>Of that book he says: &ldquo;It is a combination of drollery
with romance, which requires a great deal of pains and a perfect
throwing away of points that might be amplified, but I hope it is
<i>very good</i>&rdquo; (ii., p. 225).</p>
<p>In speaking of his public readings he refers to wearing a
flower given him.&nbsp; This doubtless explains why, when he read
at Cambridge, he wore first a red rose and then a white one in
his buttonhole, which to my undergraduate mind seemed
&ldquo;dandiacal.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of this occasion he wrote:
&ldquo;The reception at Cambridge last night was something to be
proud of in such a place.&nbsp; The colleges mustered in full
force from the biggest guns to the smallest, and went far beyond
even Manchester in the roars of welcome and the rounds of cheers.
. . .&nbsp; The place was crammed, and the success the most
brilliant I have ever seen&rdquo; (ii., p. 284).</p>
<p><!-- page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>In 1867 we again come across a reference to the
exhaustion caused by his public readings.&nbsp; &ldquo;On Friday
night I quite astonished myself; but I was taken so faint
afterwards that they laid me on a sofa at the hall for half an
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of protestations he went to America, and in regard to
his visit he wrote in 1867: &ldquo;I do not expect as much money
as the calculators estimate, but I cannot set the hope of a large
sum of money aside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And from Boston he wrote to his daughter: &ldquo;At the New
York barriers, where the tickets are on sale, . . . speculators
went up and down offering twenty dollars for anybody&rsquo;s
place.&nbsp; The money was in no case accepted&rdquo; (ii., p.
310).</p>
<p>And again: &ldquo;At nine o&rsquo;clock this morning there
were two thousand people in waiting, and they had begun to
assemble in the bitter cold as early as two o&rsquo;clock&rdquo;
(ii., p. 311).</p>
<p>And to Miss Hogarth, 16th December 1867,
N.Y.:&mdash;&ldquo;Dolby continues to be the most unpopular man
in America (mainly because he can&rsquo;t get four thousand
people into a room that holds two thousand), and is reviled in
print daily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dickens returned from America in April 1868, but soon made
another visit.&nbsp; He wrote to Wilkie Collins from
Boston:&mdash;&ldquo;Being in Boston . . . I took it into my head
to go over the medical school, and survey the holes and corners
in which that extraordinary murder was done by Webster&rdquo;
(12th Jan. 1868).</p>
<p>This must be the man who (as I was told in the U.S.) said to
his daughters, &ldquo;What should you say <!-- page 227--><a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>if I were
the murderer?&rdquo;&nbsp; They were looking at the notice of a
reward for the detection of the murderer.&nbsp; I think the body
was burnt by Webster in his laboratory.</p>
<p>In regard to his readings, he wrote: &ldquo;It was but this
last year that I set to and learned every word of my readings;
and from ten years ago to last night, I have never read to an
audience but I have watched for an opportunity of striking out
something better somewhere&rdquo; (11th Feb. 1868).</p>
<p>He was evidently overstrained and was only kept going by
stimulants.&nbsp; He wrote to Miss Dickens (29th March 1868):
&ldquo;I have coughed from two or three in the morning until five
or six, and have been absolutely sleepless.&nbsp; I have had no
appetite besides, and no taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again, to the same correspondent, he writes that he has
established this system:&mdash;&ldquo;At seven in the morning (in
bed) a tumbler of new cream and two tablespoonfuls of rum.&nbsp;
At twelve, a sherry cobbler and a biscuit.&nbsp; At three
(dinner-time) a pint of champagne.&nbsp; At five minutes to
eight, an egg beaten up in a glass of sherry.&nbsp; Between the
parts, the strongest beef-tea that can be made, drunk hot.&nbsp;
At quarter past ten, soup, and anything to drink that I can
fancy. . . .&nbsp; Dolby is as tender as a woman and as watchful
as a doctor&rdquo; (2nd April 1868).</p>
<p>On the return voyage he was asked to read, and &ldquo;I
respectfully replied that sooner than do it, I would assault the
captain, and be put in irons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he arrived at home the two Newfoundland dogs behaved
exactly as usual: this may remind us <!-- page 228--><a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>of another
C.D.&nbsp; My father used to tell us how, after his five
years&rsquo; voyage in the <i>Beagle</i>, he went into the yard
at his Shrewsbury home and whistled in a particular way, and the
dog came for a walk as if he had done the same thing the day
before.&nbsp; Two of Dickens&rsquo; dogs were, however, greatly
excited: the faithful Mrs Bouncer being one of them.</p>
<p>A letter to Cerjat (1868) gives an echo from the great railway
accident in which Dickens had so lucky an escape:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My escape in the Staplehurst accident of three years
ago is not to be obliterated from my nervous system.&nbsp; To
this hour I have sudden vague rushes of terror, even when riding
<a name="citation228"></a><a href="#footnote228"
class="citation">[228]</a> in a hansom cab, which are perfectly
unreasonable but quite insurmountable.&nbsp; I used to make
nothing of driving a pair of horses habitually through the most
crowded parts of London.&nbsp; I cannot now drive, with comfort
myself, on the country roads here; and I doubt if I could ride at
all in the saddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1866 he consulted Dr Beard about symptoms of grave
significance.&nbsp; And in 1869 Beard went down to Preston and
put a stop to a projected reading, and ruled, with the approval
of Sir Thomas Watson, that anything like a reading tour must be
finally stopped.</p>
<p>In January and March 1870, he was working at <i>Edwin
Drood</i>, his unfinished book.&nbsp; He gave some farewell
readings, and his last public appearance was at the Royal Academy
dinner, where he spoke of Maclise.</p>
<p><!-- page 229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>His daughter has given a touching account of his
death.&nbsp; He was at Gad&rsquo;s Hill on 30th May 1870 at work
over <i>Edwin Drood</i>, but there was &ldquo;an appearance of
fatigue and weariness about him very unlike his usual air of
fresh activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On 8th June 1870 he owned to being very ill.&nbsp; He became
incoherent, and being advised to lie down, he said indistinctly,
&ldquo;Yes, on the ground,&rdquo; and these were his last
words.&nbsp; In the evening of 9th June, he shuddered, gave one
sigh, a tear rolled down his face, and he died.</p>
<p>Dickens had wished to be buried in the little churchyard of
Shorne in Kent; but the authorities of Rochester Cathedral asked
that he might be buried there.&nbsp; Finally, Dean Stanley
intervened and he was buried on 14th June in Westminster
Abbey.&nbsp; His daughter says that every year on the ninth of
June flowers are strewn by &ldquo;unknown hands on that spot so
sacred to us, and to all who knew and loved him.&rdquo;</p>

class="citation">[231b]</a> with which I have compared them, the
number of recorded facts is much greater.&nbsp; I may express my
indebtedness to the minutely accurate work of this author; I only
wish that my small contribution to his subject were more worthy
of my guide.</p>
<p>What interest my observations may possess depends on the fact
that the spring of 1917 was exceptionally cold.&nbsp; For this
statement I rely on the weekly Weather Report of the
Meteorological Office, in which for each week of the year the
deviation from the normal temperature is given for a large number
<!-- page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>of stations in the British Islands. <a
name="citation232"></a><a href="#footnote232"
class="citation">[232]</a>&nbsp; I have taken as a standard the
temperature at Clifton, which seems to be the station nearest to
Gloucester.</p>
<p>Now, though the temperature has undoubtedly a great effect on
the time of flowering, it is by no means the only element in the
problem.&nbsp; The first plant on my list is <i>Ranunculus
ficaria</i>, which I noted as flowering on 1st April, whereas in
Blomefield the mean of seventeen yearly observations is 28th
February, the earliest date for this plant being 21st January,
the latest 28th March.&nbsp; The extreme lateness of the
Celandine was doubtless due to the cold spring of 1917.&nbsp; But
what are the elements of the problem which fixed on this plant
the general habit of flowering early in the year?</p>
<p>In some cases we can see the advantages in early
flowering.&nbsp; Thus the average date on which the Hazel comes
into bloom is 26th January, and this, for a plant of which the
pollen is distributed by the wind, may be an advantage, since
there are no leaves to obstruct the dispersal of the pollen
grains.</p>
<p>It may be answered that those Conifers which do not shed their
leaves in winter, <i>e.g.</i> the Yew or the Scotch Fir, are
nevertheless wind-fertilised.&nbsp; But this, though a point not
to be forgotten, is no argument against what has been said of the
Hazel.</p>
<p>On the whole, however, we are excessively ignorant as to the
biological meaning of the dates at which plants flower.&nbsp;
What advantage does the orchis <i>Spiranthes</i>, well called
<i>autumnalis</i>, gain from flowering in August or
September?&nbsp; Or again, what <!-- page 233--><a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>biological
characters are there to distinguish the plants flowering in June
from those which do not show themselves till July?&nbsp; It
looks, to put the thing fancifully, as if a parliament of plants
had met and decided that some arrangement must be made since the
world would be inconveniently full if they all flowered at once;
or they may have believed that there were not enough insects to
fertilise the whole Flora, if all their services were needed in
one glorious month of crowded life.&nbsp; Therefore it was ruled
that the months should be portioned among the aspirants, some
choosing May, others June or July.&nbsp; But it must have been
difficult to manage, and must have needed an accurate knowledge
of their own natural history.&nbsp; I must apologise for this
outbreak, and I will only add that this does seem to me an
interesting problem, namely, what are the elements in the
struggle for life which fix the dates on which plants habitually
flower?</p>
<p>The most striking instance of the effect of the temperature is
the behaviour of arctic plants. <a name="citation233"></a><a
href="#footnote233" class="citation">[233]</a>&nbsp; In Nova
Zembla the summer consists of two months, July and August, during
which the mean temperature is about 5&deg; C.&nbsp; In these
conditions, cases such as the following occur: at Pitlekaj the
last nine days of June showed a mean temperature of below 0&deg;
C., while the average for the first nine days of July was between
+4&deg; and +6&deg;, and on 10th July all the four species of
Willow were in full bloom, the dwarf Birch, <i>Sedum
palustre</i>, Polygonum, Cassiope, and Diapensia were in flower,
and within a week the whole vegetation was flowering.&nbsp; There
was, in fact, a great rush <!-- page 234--><a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>or
explosion of all sorts of flowers as soon as the temperature
rose: not that dropping fire which begins with us with Mezereon
in January and ends with Ivy in the autumn.</p>
<p>In the Arctic Regions temperature seems the absolute master,
but in our climate this is clearly not so.&nbsp; The best
evidence of an inherent tendency to flower on a certain date is
that given by Askenasy <a name="citation234"></a><a
href="#footnote234" class="citation">[234]</a> in his
observations on <i>Prunus avium</i> (the Gean or wild
Cherry).&nbsp; He recorded the weight of 100 buds at regular
intervals throughout the year, and thus got the following
results:&mdash;</p>

<p>There are thus three periods: I., Formation; II., Rest; III.,
Development.&nbsp; So much for preliminaries; the really
interesting point is the reaction of the buds to forcing by
artificially raising the temperature.&nbsp; Thus branches put
into a warm room at the end of October showed absolutely no
tendency to develop.&nbsp; In December, however, they could be
forced, and as time went on they proved to be more and more
amenable to the effect of a rise in temperature.&nbsp; In other
words, the invisible process of preparing for the spring was
automatically proceeding.&nbsp; The following figures give the
number of days of <!-- page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span

<p>My object in discussing this case is to show that the effect
of temperature on plant-development is not a simple
problem.&nbsp; The most picturesque association with what is
known as the science of Ph&aelig;nology (<i>i.e.</i> the lore of
the appearance of flowers) is its practical connection with
ancient agricultural maxims.&nbsp; Blomefield puts the thing very
clearly <a name="citation235"></a><a href="#footnote235"
class="citation">[235]</a>: &ldquo;The middle of March may be, in
the long run, the most suitable time for sowing various kinds of
grain,&rdquo; but the husbandman may easily go wrong in this or
other operations if he sticks to a fixed date.&nbsp; But if he
knows that the conditions necessary for his purpose are also
necessary for the flowering of some familiar herb, he will be
safer in waiting for his guide to show itself than in going by
dates.&nbsp; Wrongly or rightly, this assumption has been
commonly followed.</p>
<p>Stillingfleet quotes from Aristophanes that &ldquo;the crane
points out the time of sowing&rdquo; and the kite &ldquo;when it
is time to shear your sheep.&rdquo;&nbsp; An old Swedish proverb
tells us that &ldquo;when you see the white wagtail you may turn
your sheep into the fields; and when you see the wheatear you may
sow your grain.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have come across an English
proverb: &ldquo;When the sloe tree is as white as a sheet, you
<!-- page 236--><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>must sow your barley be it dry or wet.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Miss Jekyll in her book <i>Old West Surrey</i>, speaking of the
wryneck, quotes: &ldquo;When we hears that, we very soon thinks
about rining (barking) the oaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is something delightfully picturesque in the thought of
man thus helped and guided in some of his most vital operations
by the proceedings of the world of plants and animals, to whom
that hard task-master Natural Selection has taught so much.</p>
<p>I have gone through Blomefield&rsquo;s <i>Calendar</i>,
recording for each species the number of days between the
earliest and latest known dates of flowering.&nbsp; Thus the
Mezereon did not flower earlier than 11th January or later than
2nd February; this means that the date of flowering may, as far
as we know, vary to the extent of twenty-three days.</p>
<p>If we look at the recorded dates for all flowers appearing in
February, we find great irregularity.&nbsp; Thus <i>Daphne
laureola</i> has a range of twenty-two days, whereas for <i>Vinca
minor</i> the figure is 114.&nbsp; The average for February is
75.6, that for March is 55.6, for May 29.5, July 29.6.&nbsp;
These figures suggest that the range of dates of flowering
diminishes as the temperature becomes less variable.&nbsp; But
the variation in summer temperature, though small relatively to
the same factor in the cold months, may nevertheless be
sufficient to affect the flowering habit.&nbsp; Yet there must be
many factors in the problem of which we know nothing.&nbsp; It is
a curious little fact that the summer range should be roughly one
month.</p>
<p>Let us now consider my observations for 1917 as compared with
Blomefield&rsquo;s record of the mean date of flowering of the
same species.</p>
<p><!-- page 237--><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>The most striking feature occurs at the beginning of
April, when Blomefield&rsquo;s observations are on the whole
markedly earlier than my record of corresponding facts.&nbsp; Of
those noted by me as flowering in April, one should have flowered
in January, four in February, five in March, six considerably
earlier in April, and two slightly earlier in that month.</p>
<p>In May Blomefield&rsquo;s dates are still mainly earlier than
mine, in spite of the fact that in this month the temperature was
above the normal.&nbsp; In June, on the whole (though with much
variability), his dates do not seriously differ from mine.&nbsp;
In the first three weeks of June the temperature was above the
normal.&nbsp; In July, except at the beginning and end of the
month, my observations are clearly later in date than
Blomefield&rsquo;s, and during rather more than half of July the
temperature was below the normal.&nbsp; On the whole, and in
spite of many doubtful points, the difference between my results
and Blomefield&rsquo;s seems to me to be related to the curve of
temperature, in an irregular manner it is true, but sufficiently
to be worthy of record.&nbsp; It has been said <a
name="citation237"></a><a href="#footnote237"
class="citation">[237]</a> that Thoreau, the American recluse and
naturalist, knew the look of the country-side so intimately that
had he been miraculously transferred to an unknown time of year,
he would have recognised the season &ldquo;within a day or two
from the flowers at his feet.&rdquo;&nbsp; If this is true,
either American plants are much more businesslike than ours
(which is as it should be), or else Thoreau did not test his
opinions too severely, and this seems even more probable.</p>

the <i>frets</i> of the viol give to the stopped notes the
&ldquo;<i>clear ring</i>&rdquo; of the open strings.&nbsp; He
claims also that in the viol &ldquo;the manner of holding the bow
and ordering its strokes . . . prevents the strong accents
characteristic&rdquo; of the violin, and facilitates &ldquo;an
even and sustained tone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He recommends (p. 452) that frets should be added to the
Double Bass, which would &ldquo;give clearness to many rapid
passages which at present only make a rumbling noise.&rdquo;</p>

were made every year for the Whit Monday hunt which took place in
the forest.</p>

the cost of captivity . . . and the consequent loss of all his

Lord Jeffrey, 1773&ndash;1850, was the son of a high Tory, but
personally a Liberal.&nbsp; He is described as being healthy
though diminutive.&nbsp; Sydney Smith makes jokes about his
stature: <i>e.g.</i>, 3rd September 1809, &ldquo;Are we to see
you? (a difficult thing at all times to do).&rdquo;&nbsp; In
character he is described as &ldquo;nervous, sensitive, and
tender.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sydney wrote to him in 1806:&mdash;If
&ldquo;you could be alarmed into the semblance of modesty you
would charm everybody; but remember my joke against you about the
moon;&mdash;&lsquo;D---n the solar system! bad
light&mdash;planets too distant&mdash;pestered with

(1778&ndash;1817), called to the Bar in 1807, and was through the
influence of Lord Carrington returned for the borough of
Wendover.&nbsp; He was a man of sound judgment and unassuming
manners, of scrupulous integrity, and great amiability of
character.&nbsp; He was a correct and forcible speaker, and
though without the gift of humour, exercised a remarkable
influence in the House of Commons, owing to his personal
character.&nbsp; He was one of the original founders of the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, the other two being Jeffrey and Sydney
Smith.</p>
<p><a name="footnote178a"></a><a href="#citation178a"

but would never be a bishop.</p>
<p><a name="footnote183"></a><a href="#citation183"
class="footnote">[183]</a>&nbsp; It appears (i., p. 282) that he
felt deeply the fact that he had not been offered a Bishopric,
though he had made up his mind to refuse it.&nbsp; Lord Melbourne
is said to have much regretted not having made a bishop of
Sydney.</p>
<p><a name="footnote185"></a><a href="#citation185"
class="footnote">[185]</a>&nbsp; Sydney wrote of Macaulay:
&ldquo;I always prophesied his greatness from the first moment I
saw him, then a very young and unknown man, on the Northern
Circuit.&rdquo;&nbsp; His enemies might say he talked rather too
much, &ldquo;but now he has occasional flashes of silence, that
make his conversation perfectly delightful&rdquo; (i., p.

politics, and supported all measures against the slave trade and
was in favour of emancipation, and this in spite of being the
owner of &ldquo;extensive plantations in Jamaica.&rdquo;&nbsp;
After his death the following verse in his handwriting was found
on his dressing-table:&mdash;</p>

earth has nothing in it to make anyone laugh or cry.&nbsp; Yet I
think, with some confidence, that you never did either over any
passage in <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>.&nbsp; In particular, I took
Friday&rsquo;s death as one of the least tender and (in the true
sense) least sentimental things ever written. . . .&rdquo;&nbsp;
He goes on:&mdash;&ldquo;It is a book I read very much; and the

admiration thereof, grows on me the more I observe this curious
fact.&rdquo;</p>

was born in London; his mother was an actress.</p>
<p>In 1803 he went to Rugby, the idea being that he should go to
the Bar.&nbsp; In 1810 Macready made his first appearance on the
stage, taking the part of Romeo with considerable success.&nbsp;
Mrs Siddons, with whom he acted, encouraged him&mdash;telling him
to &ldquo;study, study, study, and do not marry till you are
thirty.&rdquo;&nbsp; During the four years he remained with his
father he played seventy-four parts.&nbsp; He seems to have
failed to agree with his father, and took an engagement at Bath
in 1814.&nbsp; In 1816 he made his first appearance at Covent
Garden.&nbsp; Kean was in the audience and applauded
loudly.&nbsp; His Richard III. (in London 1819) took a firm hold
of the public and established &ldquo;a dangerous rivalry for
Kean.&rdquo;&nbsp; His temper seems to have been violent, for in
1836 he knocked down Bunn as &ldquo;a damned scoundrel&rdquo; and
had to pay damages.&nbsp; In 1837 he was manager of Covent Garden
Theatre.&nbsp; He was the original Claude Melnotte in 1838.</p>
<p>In 1850 he played at Windsor Castle under Charles Kean, who
&ldquo;sent him a courteous message and received a
characteristically churlish reply.&rdquo;&nbsp; He took the last
of many farewell performances in 1851.&nbsp; His diary and
reminiscences have been edited by Sir F. Pollock.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
